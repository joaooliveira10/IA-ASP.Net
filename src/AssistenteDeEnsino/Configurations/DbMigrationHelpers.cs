the\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,560\r\nlast 1 hour and 5 hours now before we\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,280\r\ndive into the demo let's take a look at\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,599\r\nthe hardware as you can see from the\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,759\r\nscreen the hardware is pretty\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,560\r\nstraightforward we will use esp32 MCU\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,519\r\nright here as the mqtt client we will be\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,959\r\nconnecting four LEDs to the esp32 C and\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,239\r\nright here I have defined the pin but of\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:07,319\r\ncourse you can feel free to use any pin\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,000\r\nthat you want I will be using the\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,919\r\nraspberry pi 3B model but feel free to\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,080\r\nuse any Raspberry p it should work\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,080\r\nperfectly I'm showing a laptop here for\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,519\r\na reason which is representing PC\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:20,519\r\nbecause we will first build the node.js\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:23,479\r\napp on a PC in my case I'll build it on\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,878\r\nmy magc book then copy it over to the\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:29,000\r\nRaspberry Pi so you can just SSH into\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,239\r\nyour raspberry pie to run the server\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:33,280\r\nalternatively you can push the project\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,439\r\nto GitHub and clone it to the Raspberry\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:37,919\r\nPi any way that you do it is fine now\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,519\r\nlet us take a quick look at the demo now\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,878\r\nthis is the web interface of the project\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,318\r\nwhich is hosted on the Raspberry Pi now\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:47,318\r\non top we see the switch buttons that\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:49,360\r\ncontrols the various sensors that are\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,800\r\nconnected to the Raspberry Pi so\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,239\r\nwhenever we click on one the sensor that\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:58,000\r\nis connected to the esp32 it's either\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,439\r\nswitched on or off so the air quality\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,318\r\ncontrol is connected to the Sero motor\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,318\r\nthe temperature and the pressure sensors\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:09,400\r\nare both connected to the\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,000\r\nLEDs when we look at the aduno ID e all\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,239\r\nthe values that are sent via the\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,719\r\nRaspberry Pi broker is received by the\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:24,080\r\naduno rde and it shows it in the\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,959\r\nterminal so when we switch on we can see\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,360\r\none is sent and when we switch it off it\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,680\r\nS zero so when the ESP 32 receiv zero or\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,080\r\none it uses that information to either\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,239\r\nswitch on or off an LED and in case of\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,080\r\nthe Sero Moto when we turn it on it goes\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,199\r\nin the clockwise Direction and when we\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,759\r\nturn it off goes to anticlockwise\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,000\r\nDirection so the values that I received\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,919\r\nare presented in the graphs so right\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,479\r\nhere in the ID we can see every value\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,158\r\nthat is received from the Raspberry Pi\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,280\r\nbroker is logged in the terminal so when\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,438\r\nwe press the temperature on you can see\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:15,759\r\nright here temperature is one and when\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:21,759\r\nwe turn it off it to log Z to the serial\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,120\r\nID now the second web interface or the\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,839\r\nweb page will help us to query database\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,120\r\nthat is the average sensor values are\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,160\r\nsaved in the postgress CLE so when we go\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,160\r\nto that URL and we can choose the time\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,240\r\nrange in which we want to query it so\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,560\r\nlet's say we want to query in hours\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,879\r\nlet's say we want to get the values that\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,120\r\nhave been saved between the last zero\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,319\r\nand let's say 20 hours between Z and 20\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:56,120\r\nhours then we can write it and when we\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,160\r\npress on the search button it will go\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,319\r\nand the\r\n\r\n107\r\n00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:05,240\r\ndatabase and it will present it just\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,399\r\nlike that so this page is the sensor\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:11,399\r\ndata record and it is pretty simple\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,639\r\nusing\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,759\r\npostgress this is the entire Hardware of\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,038\r\nthe project that is the es32 the LEDs\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:20,519\r\nand the Raspberry\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:23,478\r\nPi to the flowchart of the program right\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:25,759\r\nhere at the center of the project is a\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,399\r\nRaspberry Pi 3 Model B it will function\r\n\r\n117\r\n00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,120\r\nas the mqtt broker and also host the\r\n\r\n118\r\n00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120\r\nnode.js server the\r\n\r\n119\r\n00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,319\r\nesp32 will be the client that publishes\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,519\r\nand also receives data from the broker\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,079\r\nnow on the back end we have a nodejs\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,000\r\nserver that is running with a postgress\r\n\r\n123\r\n00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,439\r\ncqo database because we want realtime\r\n\r\n124\r\n00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,000\r\ncommunication between the server and the\r\n\r\n125\r\n00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,560\r\nweb client we are going to use socket\r\n\r\n126\r\n00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,879\r\niio if you don't know socket iio that is\r\n\r\n127\r\n00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,800\r\nfine it allows bir directional\r\n\r\n128\r\n00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,319\r\ncommunication between the server and the\r\n\r\n129\r\n00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,839\r\nclient so that they can communicate in\r\n\r\n130\r\n00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,839\r\nreal time just as you do with instant\r\n\r\n131\r\n00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:07,759\r\nmessaging

directly with each other so\r\n\r\n173\r\n00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:00,519\r\nwe have a broker which serves as a\r\n\r\n174\r\n00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:03,038\r\ncentral point and all the clients will\r\n\r\n175\r\n00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:05,839\r\nbe connected to the broker so a client\r\n\r\n176\r\n00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,639\r\nis the device that can let's say send\r\n\r\n177\r\n00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,079\r\nmessage to the broker for example in our\r\n\r\n178\r\n00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:14,158\r\ncase our client is the\r\n\r\n179\r\n00:08:14,158 -->

manage\r\n\r\n209\r\n00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,278\r\nlibraries so in the manage libraries\r\n\r\n210\r\n00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:43,720\r\ntype popop client you can also install\r\n\r\n211\r\n00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,639\r\nthis we need this will be the two\r\n\r\n212\r\n00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:47,839\r\ninstallation that we will add leave some\r\n\r\n213\r\n00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,839\r\nspace and let's begin writing the code\r\n\r\n214\r\n00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,799\r\ninclude wifi.

length we can add everything\r\n\r\n288\r\n00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,320\r\nto the string whatever the payload is so\r\n\r\n289\r\n00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,559\r\nlet's say if the broker send something\r\n\r\n290\r\n00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:22,078\r\nlike put off the fun we will get that\r\n\r\n291\r\n00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:24,679\r\nand we will turn it into a string then\r\n\r\n292\r\n00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,320\r\nwe can print the message so now we have\r\n\r\n293\r\n00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,399\r\nthe message we need to handle the\r\n\r\n294\r\n00:13:29,399

we said\r\n\r\n299\r\n00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:45,679\r\nwe are subscribing to this topic so in\r\n\r\n300\r\n00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,159\r\nhere we will do es/ CMD that is the\r\n\r\n301\r\n00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:52,120\r\nbeautiful aspect of the mqtt protocol\r\n\r\n302\r\n00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,320\r\nyou subscribed something and you are\r\n\r\n303\r\n00:13:54,320

okay\r\n\r\n308\r\n00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,120\r\nso once this if statement is true it\r\n\r\n309\r\n00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,078\r\nmeans that we've gotten a message from\r\n\r\n310\r\n00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:17,879\r\nwhat we've subscribed to we can print\r\n\r\n311\r\n00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:20,120\r\nreceive message now when we receive\r\n\r\n312\r\n00:14:20,120

00:14:28,278\r\nmessage that is coming do this and we\r\n\r\n315\r\n00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:30,440\r\npass in the message so let's come here\r\n\r\n316\r\n00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,919\r\nand Define the function it will take a\r\n\r\n317\r\n00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:36,078\r\nstring let's pass by the\r\n\r\n318\r\n00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:38,399\r\nreference now the string that will come\r\n\r\n319\r\n00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,360\r\nin will contain the name of the sensor\r\n\r\n320\r\n00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,879\r\nand also the command so let us find\r\n\r\n321\r\n00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:45,078\r\nwhere the comma is and we separate\r\n\r\n322\r\n00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:47,198\r\nbetween the sensor name and the command\r\n\r\n323\r\n00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:49,679\r\nwe call this comma index and whatever\r\n\r\n324\r\n00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,159\r\nstring we get we try to find where the\r\n\r\n325\r\n00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,600\r\ncomma is so once we know where the comma\r\n\r\n326\r\n00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,000\r\nis we can use to extract both the name\r\n\r\n327\r\n00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,159\r\nand the command we create a string to\r\n\r\n328\r\n00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,720\r\nhold the name of the sensor sensor name\r\n\r\n329\r\n00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,320\r\nand we can use this adrenal command\r\n\r\n330\r\n00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,000\r\nsubstring we already have the index of\r\n\r\n331\r\n00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,278\r\nthe comma right here so the first part\r\n\r\n332\r\n00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,039\r\nof the string will be the name of the\r\n\r\n333\r\n00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:15,679\r\nsensor and as you right the second part\r\n\r\n334\r\n00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,078\r\nis going to be the state of the pin\r\n\r\n335\r\n00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:20,078\r\nright that is the command that we want\r\n\r\n336\r\n00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:22,519\r\nwe will call this pin State because\r\n\r\n337\r\n00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,198\r\nbasically all that we are doing is we\r\n\r\n338\r\n00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:26,679\r\nare going to write a high or low to the\r\n\r\n339\r\n00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:29,120\r\npain that the sensor is connected to p\r\n\r\n340\r\n00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,919\r\nstate is equal to string do substring\r\n\r\n341\r\n00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,278\r\nand this will be the command that comes\r\n\r\n342\r\n00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:37,639\r\nafter The Comma you do this plus one and\r\n\r\n343\r\n00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:40,120\r\nwe convert it to integer once we have\r\n\r\n344\r\n00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,759\r\neverything we can print the sensor name\r\n\r\n345\r\n00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,600\r\nand also the pin State we have decoded\r\n\r\n346\r\n00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,958\r\nthe incoming string from the broker into\r\n\r\n347\r\n00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,318\r\nthe sensor name and the pin state so we\r\n\r\n348\r\n00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:53,360\r\ncan go the next step and actually issue\r\n\r\n349\r\n00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,120\r\nthe command right we have four sensors\r\n\r\n350\r\n00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,399\r\nso we can make a switch statement and we\r\n\r\n351\r\n00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,519\r\nsay that for example if the sensor name\r\n\r\n352\r\n00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,919\r\nis temperature then write the pin state\r\n\r\n353\r\n00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,799\r\nto the temperature pin this should be\r\n\r\n354\r\n00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,519\r\nvery easy if sensor name is equal to\r\n\r\n355\r\n00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,958\r\ntemperature digital right whatever value\r\n\r\n356\r\n00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,240\r\nthat comes into the temperature pen so\r\n\r\n357\r\n00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,799\r\nwe call the temp pin and you write the\r\n\r\n358\r\n00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:18,559\r\npin State this should be easy we will do\r\n\r\n359\r\n00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,759\r\nit for the\r\n\r\n360\r\n00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,440\r\nrest we can also leave a space to handle\r\n\r\n361\r\n00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,559\r\nunknown names that are passed but we\r\n\r\n362\r\n00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,360\r\nwill leave that empty for now that\r\n\r\n363\r\n00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,278\r\nshould be all for passing the string so\r\n\r\n364\r\n00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,360\r\nnow we can come into the setup function\r\n\r\n365\r\n00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,078\r\nof the Aden code setting up the Sera\r\n\r\n366\r\n00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:39,958\r\nser. bit and\r\n\r\n367\r\n00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:43,480\r\n115200 and we can call the setup Wi-Fi\r\n\r\n368\r\n00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,559\r\nfunction that we declared right here\r\n\r\n369\r\n00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,078\r\nabove set up Wi-Fi set up Wi-Fi now we\r\n\r\n370\r\n00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,318\r\ncan also set up the client for the mqtt\r\n\r\n371\r\n00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:57,159\r\nset server inbu function we call the\r\n\r\n372\r\n00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:00,318\r\nmqtt server that we declare above and it\r\n\r\n373\r\n00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:03,559\r\ncontains the IP address of the broker\r\n\r\n374\r\n00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,959\r\nand this is the default Port that we use\r\n\r\n375\r\n00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,838\r\nfor mqtt communications and we call the\r\n\r\n376\r\n00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:12,038\r\nset callback so in the set callback\r\n\r\n377\r\n00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:14,240\r\nfunction we pass in the Callback\r\n\r\n378\r\n00:17:14,240 -->

we can also set up the pin\r\n\r\n381\r\n00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,240\r\nmodes we will do pin mode we set all the\r\n\r\n382\r\n00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,119\r\npin modes and they are all outputs\r\n\r\n383\r\n00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:32,359\r\nthat is all for the setup function in\r\n\r\n384\r\n00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:34,759\r\nthe main Loop we try to maintain\r\n\r\n385\r\n00:17:34,759

is\r\n\r\n394\r\n00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,400\r\nintact we can read the pins that the\r\n\r\n395\r\n00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,720\r\nsensors are connected to right we could\r\n\r\n396\r\n00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,279\r\nuse analog in or digital in but this\r\n\r\n397\r\n00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:12,159\r\ntime let us simulate sensor readings so\r\n\r\n398\r\n00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,599\r\nwe are going to provide random values\r\n\r\n399\r\n00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,839\r\nright so float temperature let's give\r\n\r\n400\r\n00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:20,679\r\nthe temperature a between Z and 100 and\r\n\r\n401\r\n00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:24,599\r\nwe want it to be float so let's do this\r\n\r\n402\r\n00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,400\r\ndivided by\r\n\r\n403\r\n00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,440\r\n100.0 we do similar things for the other\r\n\r\n404\r\n00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,919\r\nsensors this should work for simulating\r\n\r\n405\r\n00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,159\r\nthe values once we have the values like\r\n\r\n406\r\n00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:36,400\r\nthis we will put the values inside a\r\n\r\n407\r\n00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,519\r\nstring then we will publish it onto the\r\n\r\n408\r\n00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,000\r\ntopic so the broker is already\r\n\r\n409\r\n00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,079\r\nsubscribed to that topic and the broker\r\n\r\n410\r\n00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,079\r\nis going to receive that we call the\r\n\r\n411\r\n00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,558\r\npayload and we will use the inbu string\r\n\r\n412\r\n00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:55,159\r\nfunction to turn the float values into a\r\n\r\n413\r\n00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:58,119\r\nstring once we are done we can publish\r\n\r\n414\r\n00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:01,400\r\nit so we you can do client. publish and\r\n\r\n415\r\n00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,640\r\nwe need to indicate the topic on which\r\n\r\n416\r\n00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,400\r\nwe want to publish this so we can call\r\n\r\n417\r\n00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,079\r\nthe sensus then we call the payload we\r\n\r\n418\r\n00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,038\r\nuse the inbuild function St Str we can\r\n\r\n419\r\n00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:14,759\r\nalso print to the seral we call in the\r\n\r\n420\r\n00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:17,519\r\npayload this delay for about 5 seconds\r\n\r\n421\r\n00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,240\r\nso this means that we are going to send\r\n\r\n422\r\n00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,319\r\nthe sensor values every 5 seconds if you\r\n\r\n423\r\n00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,519\r\nwatch closely you can see something that\r\n\r\n424\r\n00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:28,519\r\nwe are publishing on this topic right\r\n\r\n425\r\n00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:30,960\r\nbut we are also receiving some values\r\n\r\n426\r\n00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,400\r\nfrom the broker on a different topic if\r\n\r\n427\r\n00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,279\r\nyou remember this okay so in this\r\n\r\n428\r\n00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:40,720\r\ninstance the esp32 clan is publishing\r\n\r\n429\r\n00:19:40,720 -->

that will be all for the program\r\n\r\n432\r\n00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:52,919\r\non the esp32 mqtt client let us move to\r\n\r\n433\r\n00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,119\r\nthe next let's make a few modifications\r\n\r\n434\r\n00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,880\r\nto add the server code to the client go\r\n\r\n435\r\n00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,880\r\nto tools manage libraries now I want you\r\n\r\n436\r\n00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,000\r\nto search for esp32 Servo um this will\r\n\r\n437\r\n00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,159\r\npop up then I want you to install it\r\n\r\n438\r\n00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,359\r\nonce you are done so include esp32 Servo\r\n\r\n439\r\n00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:12,880\r\nDoh um let's instantiate it to my Servo\r\n\r\n440\r\n00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,798\r\nand also declare a pen and call it s pin\r\n\r\n441\r\n00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,798\r\n13 just like that scroll quickly to the\r\n\r\n442\r\n00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,599\r\nsetup code and let us attach the PIN to\r\n\r\n443\r\n00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:25,240\r\nthe Sero just call the my Sero object\r\n\r\n444\r\n00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,240\r\nthat I created call attach and into that\r\n\r\n445\r\n00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,798\r\nfunction pass the servo pin once you've\r\n\r\n446\r\n00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:33,359\r\ndone that we want to create a function\r\n\r\n447\r\n00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,159\r\nand call it run Servo so this is a very\r\n\r\n448\r\n00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,720\r\nsimple function it will return nothing\r\n\r\n449\r\n00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,038\r\nand the parameter it will take int value\r\n\r\n450\r\n00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:44,240\r\nwhen the value is zero you will write\r\n\r\n451\r\n00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,000\r\nzero to the servo Moto but otherwise we\r\n\r\n452\r\n00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,880\r\nwrite 180 which means that whatever pin\r\n\r\n453\r\n00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,279\r\nthat we will attach to the servo if we\r\n\r\n454\r\n00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:55,839\r\nturn it off on the web client Sero will\r\n\r\n455\r\n00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,759\r\nmove to zero know the Sero it deals with\r\n\r\n456\r\n00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,159\r\nangles and when we switch the sensor\r\n\r\n457\r\n00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,558\r\nthat is connected to the Sero and the\r\n\r\n458\r\n00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:06,960\r\nSero will go to an angle of 180° so once\r\n\r\n459\r\n00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,599\r\nyou are done defining this function I\r\n\r\n460\r\n00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,159\r\nwant you to go to the pass string method\r\n\r\n461\r\n00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,640\r\nthat we Define here and in the else if\r\n\r\n462\r\n00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,079\r\nstatement where the sensor name is equal\r\n\r\n463\r\n00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,519\r\nair now previously we had this code\r\n\r\n464\r\n00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,240\r\ndigital right air pen State now this is\r\n\r\n465\r\n00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,200\r\nsupposed to toggle the LED that is\r\n\r\n466\r\n00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,000\r\nconnected on the air pan commment that\r\n\r\n467\r\n00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,640\r\nand instead call the Sero and pass in\r\n\r\n468\r\n00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,038\r\nthe pin State whenever from the web\r\n\r\n469\r\n00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:36,759\r\nclient we turn the air sensor on or off\r\n\r\n470\r\n00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:39,720\r\nthe Sero motor will move to zero or move\r\n\r\n471\r\n00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,679\r\nto 180 open your terminal I'll be\r\n\r\n472\r\n00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:45,000\r\nwriting this on the Mac OS but all the\r\n\r\n473\r\n00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,519\r\ninstallations that we are going to do\r\n\r\n474\r\n00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:48,919\r\ntoday I will provide a link in the\r\n\r\n475\r\n00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:50,679\r\ndescription where you can get the\r\n\r\n476\r\n00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:53,319\r\ncommand for for Linus terminal but those\r\n\r\n477\r\n00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,558\r\non Windows I think you can find a way to\r\n\r\n478\r\n00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:57,759\r\ninstall postgress CLE and also\r\n\r\n479\r\n00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:00,159\r\nmosquitoes going to use home brew if you\r\n\r\n480\r\n00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,919\r\ndon't have it I think you can install\r\n\r\n481\r\n00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,000\r\nhome brew on your Mac OS so first I will\r\n\r\n482\r\n00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,480\r\nmake sure that everything is updated we\r\n\r\n483\r\n00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,640\r\nwill install the mosquito and the\r\n\r\n484\r\n00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,599\r\ncommand is bre install mosquito now the\r\n\r\n485\r\n00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,839\r\nmosquito is for the mqtt so we will do\r\n\r\n486\r\n00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,519\r\nthis we need to wait for a while for it\r\n\r\n487\r\n00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,480\r\nto finish installing okay our\r\n\r\n488\r\n00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,480\r\ninstallation is complete all right it\r\n\r\n489\r\n00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,880\r\nhas given us the command to start this\r\n\r\n490\r\n00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,119\r\nservice\r\n\r\n491\r\n00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,278\r\nH we can do that but for now we need to\r\n\r\n492\r\n00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:34,640\r\nedit something in the configuration so\r\n\r\n493\r\n00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,798\r\nthat it will allow this to have access\r\n\r\n494\r\n00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:39,319\r\nto the server if not the server will not\r\n\r\n495\r\n00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,880\r\nallow you to have access via the IP\r\n\r\n496\r\n00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,480\r\naddress so let us do this\r\n\r\n497\r\n00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,359\r\nmosquito okay password\r\n\r\n498\r\n00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:56,240\r\nH okay okay so first we need to allow\r\n\r\n499\r\n00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,519\r\nAnonymous we can remove this\r\n\r\n500\r\n00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,599\r\nokay and also we need to add a listener\r\n\r\n501\r\n00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,558\r\nso that other devices can have access to\r\n\r\n502\r\n00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:14,119\r\nit so let's see right above this let us\r\n\r\n503\r\n00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:17,798\r\nadd listener 1883 this is the default\r\n\r\n504\r\n00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:18,880\r\nport for\r\n\r\n505\r\n00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,119\r\nmqtt\r\n\r\n506\r\n00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,319\r\n0.0.0.0 so that this will allow anybody\r\n\r\n507\r\n00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,919\r\non the network the home network to have\r\n\r\n508\r\n00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,278\r\naccess to the mosquito once we are done\r\n\r\n509\r\n00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:32,440\r\nwe can save it and you can choose to\r\n\r\n510\r\n00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,240\r\nedit with anything but I prefer to use\r\n\r\n511\r\n00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,759\r\nthem maybe you can use nanu or something\r\n\r\n512\r\n00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,240\r\nat this point we can start the service\r\n\r\n513\r\n00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,599\r\nor restart it\r\n\r\n514\r\n00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:47,200\r\nmosito we are done with this the next\r\n\r\n515\r\n00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,679\r\ninstallation that we need to do is to\r\n\r\n516\r\n00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,519\r\nset up postgress SQL on our system now\r\n\r\n517\r\n00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,798\r\nif you don't have postgress installed we\r\n\r\n518\r\n00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:57,519\r\nwill once again we can choose to update\r\n\r\n519\r\n00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,038\r\nre update\r\n\r\n520\r\n00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,400\r\nthen we can do bre install\r\n\r\n521\r\n00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,839\r\npostgress CLE okay so just like this\r\n\r\n522\r\n00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,480\r\npostgress C enter okay we wait for a few\r\n\r\n523\r\n00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,079\r\nminutes it looks like our postgress is\r\n\r\n524\r\n00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:14,679\r\nalready started all right these are the\r\n\r\n525\r\n00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:17,079\r\ntwo main installations that we need to\r\n\r\n526\r\n00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,319\r\nthe next thing is to create our node.js\r\n\r\n527\r\n00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:22,679\r\napplication and do some small npm\r\n\r\n528\r\n00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:25,200\r\npackage installation I have just created\r\n\r\n529\r\n00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,278\r\na folder called developer and inside\r\n\r\n530\r\n00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:29,798\r\nthat there is a direct code server this\r\n\r\n531\r\n00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:32,159\r\nis where I'm going to write my code as\r\n\r\n532\r\n00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,558\r\nusual to start a nodejs application we\r\n\r\n533\r\n00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:39,398\r\ncan do npm in it you can press enter to\r\n\r\n534\r\n00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:43,119\r\naccept the default we will add G later\r\n\r\n535\r\n00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,720\r\nkeyw nothing then maybe you can type in\r\n\r\n536\r\n00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,359\r\nyour\r\n\r\n537\r\n00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:52,119\r\nname okay so let's see okay we need to\r\n\r\n538\r\n00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:54,519\r\nmake some few package installation when\r\n\r\n539\r\n00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:56,679\r\nyou look at our diagram you can we are\r\n\r\n540\r\n00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:00,278\r\ngoing to use soet iio we use mqtt we are\r\n\r\n541\r\n00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:03,079\r\ngoing to use express for the nodejs\r\n\r\n542\r\n00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:05,278\r\napplication and also we are going to use\r\n\r\n543\r\n00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:07,599\r\na postgress Eco so go back to the\r\n\r\n544\r\n00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:10,278\r\nterminal and let's do npm and install\r\n\r\n545\r\n00:25:10,278 --> 00:25:14,880\r\nfew packages so we will install Express\r\n\r\n546\r\n00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,640\r\nHTTP PG and\r\n\r\n547\r\n00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,798\r\nsocket.io these are the main packages\r\n\r\n548\r\n00:25:19,798 -->

you will just call this function\r\n\r\n702\r\n00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,638\r\nhere so this function will be called\r\n\r\n703\r\n00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:51,079\r\nautomatically in case the table does not\r\n\r\n704\r\n00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:53,480\r\nexist so we say create table sensor\r\n\r\n705\r\n00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,398\r\nlet's add if not exist if we already\r\n\r\n706\r\n00:32:56,398

get\r\n\r\n711\r\n00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,119\r\nall sensor data now we are going to do a\r\n\r\n712\r\n00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,679\r\ntry and\r\n\r\n713\r\n00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,880\r\ncatch let's put an error if there is an\r\n\r\n714\r\n00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,599\r\nerror we will throw that error throw new\r\n\r\n715\r\n00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,519\r\nerror now inside the try block here we\r\n\r\n716\r\n00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:23,119\r\ncan do constant result we call the pull\r\n\r\n717\r\n00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:25,679\r\nobject and we pass in the query we

--> 00:34:58,679\r\nlet's do a try block here you're going\r\n\r\n751\r\n00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,320\r\nto do select star from sensor data this\r\n\r\n752\r\n00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,119\r\ntime we will use the word clause now if\r\n\r\n753\r\n00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,239\r\nwe look at our database you can see we\r\n\r\n754\r\n00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:09,519\r\nhave a time stamp filed so we are going\r\n\r\n755\r\n00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:11,800\r\nto use that so where the time stamp we\r\n\r\n756\r\n00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,920\r\nwant to find the time stamp between\r\n\r\n757\r\n00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,280\r\ncertain period of time right let's go to\r\n\r\n758\r\n00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,960\r\nthe next line and do time time between\r\n\r\n759\r\n00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,559\r\nnow and we need to subtract let's get\r\n\r\n760\r\n00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:24,519\r\nthe time the time that we passed here\r\n\r\n761\r\n00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:26,838\r\nthis time we get time end so this is\r\n\r\n762\r\n00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:29,039\r\ngoing to be an object so that object\r\n\r\n763\r\n00:35:29,039

query go to next line now we will\r\n\r\n766\r\n00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,320\r\nget the time start so now minus interval\r\n\r\n767\r\n00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,599\r\nwe do the same thing this time is going\r\n\r\n768\r\n00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,559\r\nto be time do time start also in hours\r\n\r\n769\r\n00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:47,320\r\nand we will bring a semic column this\r\n\r\n770\r\n00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,960\r\nquery will do that for us it will get\r\n\r\n771\r\n00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,159\r\nthe sensor data within a specific

and\r\n\r\n774\r\n00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,119\r\nwe pass in the query once we get it we\r\n\r\n775\r\n00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,119\r\ncan return the result and this time it's\r\n\r\n776\r\n00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,239\r\ngoing to be a lot of rows we return\r\n\r\n777\r\n00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,838\r\neverything now let's cat the\r\n\r\n778\r\n00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:12,800\r\nerror the next function will help us to\r\n\r\n779\r\n00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,920\r\ninsert sensor data into the table right\r\n\r\n780\r\n00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,039\r\nand also we will create a function that\r\n\r\n781\r\n00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:20,519\r\nwill delete a row from the table so the\r\n\r\n782\r\n00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,519\r\nfunction to insert we will call

JS which is inside the\r\n\r\n865\r\n00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:57,559\r\nservices directory now that we we are\r\n\r\n866\r\n00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:00,838\r\ndone with the sensus model. JS go to the\r\n\r\n867\r\n00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:03,480\r\nservices directory that we created and\r\n\r\n868\r\n00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,440\r\nlet's write the code for the sensus do\r\n\r\n869\r\n00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,838\r\nservice first thing that we do is to\r\n\r\n870\r\n00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,679\r\nimport the model that we defined so we\r\n\r\n871\r\n00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:13,519\r\ndo constant sensor\r\n\r\n872\r\n00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:16,880\r\nmodel we go to the model class then we\r\n\r\n873\r\n00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,199\r\nselect sensors. model we will Define a\r\n\r\n874\r\n00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:21,920\r\nservice function for each of the models\r\n\r\n875\r\n00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,679\r\nthat we defined what I mean is when you\r\n\r\n876\r\n00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:27,639\r\ngo back to service. model. Js all these\r\n\r\n877\r\n00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,719\r\nfunctions we need to create service\r\n\r\n878\r\n00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,358\r\nfunctions for them starting with the\r\n\r\n879\r\n00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:33,838\r\nfirst one We Begin by saying export now\r\n\r\n880\r\n00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:35,920\r\nwhen we do the export it means that we\r\n\r\n881\r\n00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,559\r\nare exporting directly the previous one\r\n\r\n882\r\n00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:41,159\r\nafter defining the functions we exported\r\n\r\n883\r\n00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:44,159\r\nbut one way is that we can also do it\r\n\r\n884\r\n00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,358\r\ndirectly export. getet or sensor data\r\n\r\n885\r\n00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:50,800\r\nthis also going to be synchronous and we\r\n\r\n886\r\n00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,760\r\ndo our Tri block basically we are going\r\n\r\n887\r\n00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,838\r\nto call the similar function in the\r\n\r\n888\r\n00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:58,880\r\nmodel so we will return sensor model we\r\n\r\n889\r\n00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,639\r\ncall the get all sensor data if there is\r\n\r\n890\r\n00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:05,039\r\nan error we will throw that\r\n\r\n891\r\n00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:07,599\r\nerror so seeing that this is very easy\r\n\r\n892\r\n00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,800\r\nyou can go ahead and do the same for the\r\n\r\n893\r\n00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,079\r\nrest of the functions in the model you\r\n\r\n894\r\n00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,960\r\ncan do get sensor by ID now because we\r\n\r\n895\r\n00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,719\r\nare getting sensor by ID we need to pass\r\n\r\n896\r\n00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:18,719\r\nthe\r\n\r\n897\r\n00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:21,559\r\nID whenever we call it so that we can\r\n\r\n898\r\n00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:22,800\r\ngive it to the\r\n\r\n899\r\n00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,639\r\nmodel next function could be the get\r\n\r\n900\r\n00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:28,519\r\nsensor within range and that one we\r\n\r\n901\r\n00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:32,039\r\nwould give it the time just as we did\r\n\r\n902\r\n00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:33,760\r\nhere it is this function that we are\r\n\r\n903\r\n00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,719\r\ncalling

function create sensor\r\n\r\n907\r\n00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,358\r\ndata you can past\r\n\r\n908\r\n00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:51,079\r\nitate and when we create sensor data we\r\n\r\n909\r\n00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:57,800\r\npass the data to it\r\n\r\n910\r\n00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,760\r\nnow we need to do the same for the\r\n\r\n911\r\n00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,599\r\ndelete sensor data can choose to\r\n\r\n912\r\n00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:10,599\r\nwrite the delete will take the\r\n\r\n913\r\n00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:13,519\r\nID we have created the

00:46:05,880\r\nentity or the sensor data same process\r\n\r\n997\r\n00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,960\r\nwe call the delete sensor data and we\r\n\r\n998\r\n00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,159\r\npass the ID so we get it from the\r\n\r\n999\r\n00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:14,599\r\nparameters that is we pass it in the get\r\n\r\n1000\r\n00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:18,280\r\nrequest if not an error occurred okay so\r\n\r\n1001\r\n00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,679\r\nwe have defined the controllers for this\r\n\r\n1002\r\n00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:23,159\r\napplication the next thing is for us to\r\n\r\n1003\r\n00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:25,760\r\nRoute everything so if we look at how it\r\n\r\n1004\r\n00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,239\r\nworks the service calls the model the\r\n\r\n1005\r\n00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:30,519\r\ncontroller calls the service now we will\r\n\r\n1006\r\n00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:33,239\r\ngo and Route the request so that when\r\n\r\n1007\r\n00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:35,358\r\nthe request comes in we can route it to\r\n\r\n1008\r\n00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:38,039\r\na particular controller so first let us\r\n\r\n1009\r\n00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:40,079\r\nget\r\n\r\n1010\r\n00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,119\r\nExpress and we will also get the router\r\n\r\n1011\r\n00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,039\r\nexpress.\r\n\r\n1012\r\n00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:48,358\r\nRouter we will get the controller so\r\n\r\n1013\r\n00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:50,079\r\nsensor\r\n\r\n1014\r\n00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,880\r\ncontroller we go to the controller\r\n\r\n1015\r\n00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,440\r\ndirectory we select this we are going to\r\n\r\n1016\r\n00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,838\r\nroute each request to the functions that\r\n\r\n1017\r\n00:46:58,838 --> 00:47:02,679\r\nwe have created so first we can do post\r\n\r\n1018\r\n00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:04,920\r\nwhen the post comes in like this then we\r\n\r\n1019\r\n00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,199\r\nwill route it to sensor controller do\r\n\r\n1020\r\n00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:10,599\r\ncreate sensor data you can do a get\r\n\r\n1021\r\n00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:14,679\r\nrequest on this slash sensor controller\r\n\r\n1022\r\n00:47:14,679 --> 00:47:17,119\r\nget all sensor data now what this means\r\n\r\n1023\r\n00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,440\r\nis for example if we have a domain name\r\n\r\n1024\r\n00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,159\r\nright and Slash and it's a get request\r\n\r\n1025\r\n00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:24,519\r\nthen the request will be routed to this\r\n\r\n1026\r\n00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:26,920\r\nright we can do router do if we want\r\n\r\n1027\r\n00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,800\r\nwant to search we can call the get\r\n\r\n1028\r\n00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,280\r\nsensor data within the range so that\r\n\r\n1029\r\n00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,440\r\nwill be a post request if we want to get\r\n\r\n1030\r\n00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,280\r\na request by the ID so if a request\r\n\r\n1031\r\n00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:43,159\r\ncomes in by this path then it can get\r\n\r\n1032\r\n00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:48,519\r\nsensor by ID the next is to Route the\r\n\r\n1033\r\n00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:52,400\r\ndelete so if the delete comes in ID we\r\n\r\n1034\r\n00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,400\r\ncan map this to delete when we are done\r\n\r\n1035\r\n00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,358\r\nwe need to export the router and this is\r\n\r\n1036\r\n00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:01,880\r\nvery easy so in the same directory go to\r\n\r\n1037\r\n00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,679\r\nthe index. JX now before we begin to\r\n\r\n1038\r\n00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:08,800\r\nwrite the entry point of our program\r\n\r\n1039\r\n00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,800\r\nthat is the\r\n\r\n1040\r\n00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,480\r\nindex.js we need to install something\r\n\r\n1041\r\n00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,880\r\nwhen you look at our package you can see\r\n\r\n1042\r\n00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,719\r\nall the dependencies that we have\r\n\r\n1043\r\n00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:22,280\r\nExpress HTTP mqtt postgress and socket\r\n\r\n1044\r\n00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,960\r\niio we need to make a last installment\r\n\r\n1045\r\n00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,800\r\nfor ejs ejs embedded JavaScript it\r\n\r\n1046\r\n00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,519\r\nallows us to embed data into HTML file\r\n\r\n1047\r\n00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:35,199\r\nfor example if we query our database and\r\n\r\n1048\r\n00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:37,960\r\nwe get rows of data we can decide to\r\n\r\n1049\r\n00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,760\r\nembed it inside HTML so go to your\r\n\r\n1050\r\n00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,760\r\nterminal and move back to the main\r\n\r\n1051\r\n00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,920\r\napplication that is the server and we\r\n\r\n1052\r\n00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,079\r\nwill do npm install\r\n\r\n1053\r\n00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,639\r\nejs now the package is installed it\r\n\r\n1054\r\n00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:55,199\r\nlooked like it required root access open\r\n\r\n1055\r\n00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:58,480\r\nyour index.js with vs code or whatever\r\n\r\n1056\r\n00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,960\r\neditor you are using first we will get\r\n\r\n1057\r\n00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,960\r\nExpress we will get\r\n\r\n1058\r\n00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,599\r\nmqtt we will make up out of the express\r\n\r\n1059\r\n00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,798\r\nif you know how Express works then we\r\n\r\n1060\r\n00:49:09,798 --> 00:49:12,079\r\nwill get the port as I said we are going\r\n\r\n1061\r\n00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,880\r\nto run it on Local Host so we could make\r\n\r\n1062\r\n00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,159\r\nit Port 3,000 and this is the nodejs\r\n\r\n1063\r\n00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:19,798\r\nserver so that when you go into your\r\n\r\n1064\r\n00:49:19,798 --> 00:49:23,920\r\nbrowser you can type HTTP colou SL your\r\n\r\n1065\r\n00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,559\r\nIP address colon 3000 then we can get\r\n\r\n1066\r\n00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,798\r\nthe the HTTP to require HTTP next we can\r\n\r\n1067\r\n00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:34,920\r\nget a server out of the HTTP that we\r\n\r\n1068\r\n00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,960\r\ncreated the HTTP do create server and\r\n\r\n1069\r\n00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,519\r\ninside the server we will add the app\r\n\r\n1070\r\n00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,760\r\nthis app that we got from the express we\r\n\r\n1071\r\n00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,519\r\nwill get a path object because we will\r\n\r\n1072\r\n00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:48,079\r\nbe saving static files on the web\r\n\r\n1073\r\n00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,199\r\nclient the next one we will do this\r\n\r\n1074\r\n00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:54,760\r\nserver and we will require soet iio we\r\n\r\n1075\r\n00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,920\r\nare going to use soet iio and we need a\r\n\r\n1076\r\n00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,280\r\nserver to do that so once we have this\r\n\r\n1077\r\n00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,358\r\nwe can do IO is equal to then we call\r\n\r\n1078\r\n00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:05,318\r\nthe server that we have already defined\r\n\r\n1079\r\n00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:08,119\r\nup here so we create a new instant out\r\n\r\n1080\r\n00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:11,599\r\nof that server and we pass in the HTTP\r\n\r\n1081\r\n00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,480\r\nserver right so we need to create a\r\n\r\n1082\r\n00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,239\r\nserver for the soet\r\n\r\n1083\r\n00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:18,239\r\niio whenever a request come in it needs\r\n\r\n1084\r\n00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,119\r\nto be routed can Define constant routes\r\n\r\n1085\r\n00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,318\r\nwe go back into the source and Source we\r\n\r\n1086\r\n00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:28,119\r\nget routes and you get the index JS and\r\n\r\n1087\r\n00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:30,798\r\nthe last thing we can get sensor model\r\n\r\n1088\r\n00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:34,079\r\nSource models and sensors. model we will\r\n\r\n1089\r\n00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,798\r\nset up the embedded JavaScript we call\r\n\r\n1090\r\n00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:39,599\r\nup. set we call view engine that is the\r\n\r\n1091\r\n00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,798\r\ndefault name for this and we will use\r\n\r\n1092\r\n00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:44,559\r\nejs now we also want to specify a\r\n\r\n1093\r\n00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,679\r\ndirectory which will contain the static\r\n\r\n1094\r\n00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:49,639\r\nfiles that is our web pages so so we can\r\n\r\n1095\r\n00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:52,639\r\ndo app. set we need to specify from\r\n\r\n1096\r\n00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:54,239\r\nwhich directory we are serving our\r\n\r\n1097\r\n00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:56,838\r\nstatic files so we will do views like\r\n\r\n1098\r\n00:50:56,838 --> 00:50:59,119\r\nthat then we call the path object that\r\n\r\n1099\r\n00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,318\r\nwe created then join directory name and\r\n\r\n1100\r\n00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:04,519\r\nwe want to be serving from the public\r\n\r\n1101\r\n00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,798\r\ndirectory we are not going to save every\r\n\r\n1102\r\n00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:09,519\r\nsensor data or row of sensor data that\r\n\r\n1103\r\n00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:12,039\r\ncomes in so we create a buffer and for\r\n\r\n1104\r\n00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:14,440\r\nexample we will save about 5 minutes of\r\n\r\n1105\r\n00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,519\r\ndata inside this buffer after the buffer\r\n\r\n1106\r\n00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:18,480\r\nis completed we will find the average\r\n\r\n1107\r\n00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,318\r\nand we will save the average inside the\r\n\r\n1108\r\n00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:23,119\r\ndata base let sensor buffer you set it\r\n\r\n1109\r\n00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,239\r\nto empty array Middle where to pass\r\n\r\n1110\r\n00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:27,480\r\nJason data we are going to use express.\r\n\r\n1111\r\n00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,000\r\nJson we call it like that now we add\r\n\r\n1112\r\n00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,079\r\nrouting here so that when HTTP request\r\n\r\n1113\r\n00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:34,719\r\ncomes in it will route it to the\r\n\r\n1114\r\n00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:38,798\r\nappropriate API so we can do app. use we\r\n\r\n1115\r\n00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:41,639\r\nwill say like API which means that\r\n\r\n1116\r\n00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:44,318\r\nwhenever a request comes in and it has\r\n\r\n1117\r\n00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:46,639\r\nthis this after the domain name right\r\n\r\n1118\r\n00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:49,679\r\nthen it will be routed to\r\n\r\n1119\r\n00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:53,400\r\nthis now it's time to set up the mqtt so\r\n\r\n1120\r\n00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,000\r\nwe can just create a constant and call\r\n\r\n1121\r\n00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,318\r\nit m mqtt client and this one we are\r\n\r\n1122\r\n00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:03,358\r\ngoing to call the mqtt that we created\r\n\r\n1123\r\n00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:07,960\r\nup here this so we do mqtt and connect\r\n\r\n1124\r\n00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,318\r\nnow inside this connect we are going to\r\n\r\n1125\r\n00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:13,480\r\nadd this and also we will add our IP\r\n\r\n1126\r\n00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,719\r\naddress now the IP address that my\r\n\r\n1127\r\n00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:18,838\r\nRaspberry Pi has is this look at yours\r\n\r\n1128\r\n00:52:18,838 --> 00:52:20,719\r\nyou can go to your Linux terminal and\r\n\r\n1129\r\n00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:23,199\r\ntype if config it will show you the IP\r\n\r\n1130\r\n00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:25,519\r\naddress so we type in the IP address and\r\n\r\n1131\r\n00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:27,519\r\nwe type in the default for for once we\r\n\r\n1132\r\n00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,599\r\nhave our mqtt object we are going to\r\n\r\n1133\r\n00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:32,798\r\nDefine two main functions that is when\r\n\r\n1134\r\n00:52:32,798 --> 00:52:36,519\r\nthe mqtt is connected and also when\r\n\r\n1135\r\n00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:39,920\r\nmessage comes in we do mqtt client

you\r\n\r\n1195\r\n00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,400\r\nneed to do is that you need to emit data\r\n\r\n1196\r\n00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,639\r\nand you go to where you want to get that\r\n\r\n1197\r\n00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:23,039\r\ndata for example when we start writing\r\n\r\n1198\r\n00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:26,480\r\nthe HTML we will call socket iio

function we've not created yet but\r\n\r\n1206\r\n00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:45,960\r\nwe will create so you know we have two\r\n\r\n1207\r\n00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,760\r\nmain functions that we will create we\r\n\r\n1208\r\n00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,519\r\nhave this to convert the incoming string\r\n\r\n1209\r\n00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:52,760\r\nto object and also this function that\r\n\r\n1210\r\n00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,480\r\nwill save the average of the sensor data\r\n\r\n1211\r\n00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,960\r\nthat we have recorded over a period of

the\r\n\r\n1232\r\n00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,920\r\ndatabase so we say constant data and\r\n\r\n1233\r\n00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,318\r\nthis is why we defined the sensor model\r\n\r\n1234\r\n00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:04,920\r\nwe imported it here if you go up you see\r\n\r\n1235\r\n00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,199\r\nthe sensor model we want to access the\r\n\r\n1236\r\n00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:09,719\r\ndatabase directly sensor model then we\r\n\r\n1237\r\n00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:12,599\r\nget all sensor data and we will send the\r\n\r\n1238\r\n00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:16,199\r\nresponse now we will be using the ejs\r\n\r\n1239\r\n00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,358\r\nembedded JavaScript so with that you\r\n\r\n1240\r\n00:57:18,358 --> 00:57:21,199\r\ncall res. render we give the file name\r\n\r\n1241\r\n00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:23,400\r\nthe data that we quered from the\r\n\r\n1242\r\n00:57:23,400

the\r\n\r\n1284\r\n00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,440\r\nserver the server will receive it and\r\n\r\n1285\r\n00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,480\r\nthe server will perform the database\r\n\r\n1286\r\n00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,559\r\nquery now when the server perform the\r\n\r\n1287\r\n00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,639\r\ndatabase query it will send back the\r\n\r\n1288\r\n00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:21,559\r\nresults to be updated on the web client\r\n\r\n1289\r\n00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:23,838\r\nnow we will create this socket and we'll\r\n\r\n1290\r\n00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:26,358\r\ncall it search time range this is going\r\n\r\n1291\r\n00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:29,599\r\nto be a synchronous we are expecting a\r\n\r\n1292\r\n00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,358\r\nsearch time from the user or the client\r\n\r\n1293\r\n00:59:32,358 --> 00:59:34,159\r\ninside here we are going inside the\r\n\r\n1294\r\n00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:36,440\r\ndatabase to retrieve the time period the\r\n\r\n1295\r\n00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,318\r\nuser wants to see return data and this\r\n\r\n1296\r\n00:59:39,318 --> 00:59:41,400\r\ntime we call the sensor model and we\r\n\r\n1297\r\n00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,119\r\nwill get sensor data within range that\r\n\r\n1298\r\n00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:46,079\r\nwe defined and we will pass the search\r\n\r\n1299\r\n00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,318\r\ntime just like that after retrieving it\r\n\r\n1300\r\n00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,920\r\nwe will emit it back to the client so\r\n\r\n1301\r\n00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,159\r\nwhat is important is that you emit it on\r\n\r\n1302\r\n00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:55,199\r\na different channel so you use a\r\n\r\n1303\r\n00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:57,280\r\ndifferent name received range and we\r\n\r\n1304\r\n00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,400\r\nwill send the return data so when we go\r\n\r\n1305\r\n00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,199\r\nto the client and we also do soet Doon\r\n\r\n1306\r\n01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:04,239\r\nRec range it will give us the data that\r\n\r\n1307\r\n01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:06,838\r\nis the Simplicity of using socket iio we\r\n\r\n1308\r\n01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:08,519\r\ncall two functions that we have not\r\n\r\n1309\r\n01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:11,239\r\ndefined yet so we can start defining\r\n\r\n1310\r\n01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:13,599\r\nthem so convert payload string to object\r\n\r\n1311\r\n01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,159\r\ngo down here and let's create that\r\n\r\n1312\r\n01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:19,280\r\nfunction so this function as we Define\r\n\r\n1313\r\n01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,280\r\nis going to take as parameter a string\r\n\r\n1314\r\n01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,798\r\nokay so we will pass a parameter like\r\n\r\n1315\r\n01:00:24,798 --> 01:00:26,760\r\npayload string as we said when we get\r\n\r\n1316\r\n01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,719\r\nthe string we are going to convert it\r\n\r\n1317\r\n01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:31,599\r\ninto a JavaScript object we will kind of\r\n\r\n1318\r\n01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:34,400\r\nsplit the string using the split command\r\n\r\n1319\r\n01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,440\r\ninto an array so now we are going to\r\n\r\n1320\r\n01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,719\r\ncall the split function on the string\r\n\r\n1321\r\n01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:40,440\r\nthat we will be receiving which means\r\n\r\n1322\r\n01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,400\r\nthat the four sensors that we have we'll\r\n\r\n1323\r\n01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,719\r\nbe sending the values like temperature\r\n\r\n1324\r\n01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:47,199\r\ncomma pressure comma air quality comma\r\n\r\n1325\r\n01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:49,559\r\nand light intensity so we will split\r\n\r\n1326\r\n01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:51,920\r\nthem into an array and we return an\r\n\r\n1327\r\n01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,519\r\nobject we can do return object we give\r\n\r\n1328\r\n01:00:54,519 --> 01:00:56,920\r\nthe field for the object so let's say\r\n\r\n1329\r\n01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,039\r\nbut we need to convert them to float\r\n\r\n1330\r\n01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:01,039\r\nthat is how we Define our project the\r\n\r\n1331\r\n01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:03,960\r\nfirst value will be for temperature the\r\n\r\n1332\r\n01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,239\r\nsecond will be for pressure the next one\r\n\r\n1333\r\n01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:09,239\r\nwill be air quality the last will be the\r\n\r\n1334\r\n01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:11,199\r\nlight\r\n\r\n1335\r\n01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:14,000\r\nintensity so this function will pass the\r\n\r\n1336\r\n01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,559\r\nstring and convert it to a JavaScript\r\n\r\n1337\r\n01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,599\r\nobject delete this\r\n\r\n1338\r\n01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:21,000\r\nsemicolon the last function we need to\r\n\r\n1339\r\n01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,400\r\nDefine is the function to save the\r\n\r\n1340\r\n01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,480\r\naverage sensor data so scroll to the\r\n\r\n1341\r\n01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,760\r\nbottom and let's define the function\r\n\r\n1342\r\n01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,559\r\nasync we paste the name and it is going\r\n\r\n1343\r\n01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:33,880\r\nto take the data now first let us push\r\n\r\n1344\r\n01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,639\r\nit to the buffer that we created as we\r\n\r\n1345\r\n01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:38,599\r\nsaid we are not going to store every\r\n\r\n1346\r\n01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:40,760\r\nsensor data that we get but rather we'll\r\n\r\n1347\r\n01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,960\r\nput them inside the buffer and when the\r\n\r\n1348\r\n01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,880\r\ndata is collected over 5 minutes okay\r\n\r\n1349\r\n01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,559\r\nthen we will find the average and send\r\n\r\n1350\r\n01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:50,358\r\nit we will do push and we push the data\r\n\r\n1351\r\n01:01:50,358 --> 01:01:52,960\r\ninside here now we will write our logic\r\n\r\n1352\r\n01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,358\r\nhere we are going to send sensor data\r\n\r\n1353\r\n01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:56,480\r\nfrom the\r\n\r\n1354\r\n01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,119\r\nevery 5 seconds if that is the case it\r\n\r\n1355\r\n01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,519\r\nmeans that we will have 60 samples in 5\r\n\r\n1356\r\n01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:04,719\r\nminutes okay so whenever we check the\r\n\r\n1357\r\n01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:07,318\r\nlength of the buffer and it is greater\r\n\r\n1358\r\n01:02:07,318 --> 01:02:09,960\r\nthan or equal to 60 then we can say that\r\n\r\n1359\r\n01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,960\r\nokay we've collected data over a period\r\n\r\n1360\r\n01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,239\r\nof 5 minutes so we can do if sensor\r\n\r\n1361\r\n01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:17,358\r\nbuffer do length right if it is greater\r\n\r\n1362\r\n01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:20,079\r\nthan or equal to 60 inside here we will\r\n\r\n1363\r\n01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:22,119\r\nfind the average sensor data that you\r\n\r\n1364\r\n01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:24,920\r\nwant to save inside the database so we\r\n\r\n1365\r\n01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,440\r\nwill create the variable\r\n\r\n1366\r\n01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,440\r\nyou start with the temperature average\r\n\r\n1367\r\n01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,880\r\ntemperature we call the buffer here and\r\n\r\n1368\r\n01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,480\r\nwe are going to use the JavaScript\r\n\r\n1369\r\n01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,519\r\nreduce function we call the reduce and\r\n\r\n1370\r\n01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,599\r\nwe are going to sum all the temperature\r\n\r\n1371\r\n01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:41,920\r\nvalues after that we will divide by the\r\n\r\n1372\r\n01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,358\r\nlength of the sensor buffer so here we\r\n\r\n1373\r\n01:02:44,358 --> 01:02:48,239\r\ncan put sensor buffer do length Okay now\r\n\r\n1374\r\n01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:50,400\r\ncome back inside and let's write the\r\n\r\n1375\r\n01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,760\r\nJavaScript function to do that we are\r\n\r\n1376\r\n01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,039\r\ngoing to look through all of them and\r\n\r\n1377\r\n01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:58,159\r\nadd the temperature variable and we\r\n\r\n1378\r\n01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:01,159\r\nbring zero what we can do is we can just\r\n\r\n1379\r\n01:03:01,159 --> 01:03:03,519\r\ncopy it for the rest can copy and paste\r\n\r\n1380\r\n01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:05,318\r\nit four\r\n\r\n1381\r\n01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:08,199\r\ntimes so when you come here it will be D\r\n\r\n1382\r\n01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:11,239\r\ndo pressure average air quality and the\r\n\r\n1383\r\n01:03:11,239 --> 01:03:14,000\r\nlast one will be the light intensity\r\n\r\n1384\r\n01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,679\r\nonce we have this we can put them back\r\n\r\n1385\r\n01:03:16,679 --> 01:03:19,679\r\ninto a JavaScript object and we call the\r\n\r\n1386\r\n01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:22,798\r\nAPI to save it we can do constant maybe\r\n\r\n1387\r\n01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:24,199\r\nsave\r\n\r\n1388\r\n01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:26,318\r\nobject temperature\r\n\r\n1389\r\n01:03:26,318 --> 01:03:29,400\r\nwe convert it to float as usual average\r\n\r\n1390\r\n01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,838\r\ntemperature and we only want two decimal\r\n\r\n1391\r\n01:03:32,838 --> 01:03:36,159\r\nplaces we will do the same for the\r\n\r\n1392\r\n01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:38,760\r\nrest so this is the object that we have\r\n\r\n1393\r\n01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:42,079\r\ncreated then we can call the API to save\r\n\r\n1394\r\n01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,278\r\nit after saving it in the database it\r\n\r\n1395\r\n01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:46,440\r\nwill return the results then because we\r\n\r\n1396\r\n01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,519\r\nare going to call the model to do that\r\n\r\n1397\r\n01:03:48,519 --> 01:03:50,239\r\nwe need to make it async then we will\r\n\r\n1398\r\n01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:52,519\r\ncall the create sensor data that we\r\n\r\n1399\r\n01:03:52,519 --> 01:03:54,838\r\ncreated for the API and we will pass the\r\n\r\n1400\r\n01:03:54,838 --> 01:03:58,159\r\nsave object save obj correct this one\r\n\r\n1401\r\n01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:00,278\r\nlet's make it like this so after saving\r\n\r\n1402\r\n01:04:00,278 --> 01:04:03,000\r\nit we can print to the console and see\r\n\r\n1403\r\n01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,798\r\nif the return return value was correct\r\n\r\n1404\r\n01:04:05,798 --> 01:04:07,798\r\nthen after that we need to clear the\r\n\r\n1405\r\n01:04:07,798 --> 01:04:10,358\r\nbuffer so that it will store the next 60\r\n\r\n1406\r\n01:04:10,358 --> 01:04:12,599\r\nrow of values that will be coming from\r\n\r\n1407\r\n01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,838\r\nthe esp32\r\n\r\n1408\r\n01:04:14,838 --> 01:04:18,278\r\nclient you make it empty all right that\r\n\r\n1409\r\n01:04:18,278 --> 01:04:20,798\r\nis all for this you just do server.\r\n\r\n1410\r\n01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:23,358\r\nlisten we created the port already\r\n\r\n1411\r\n01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:26,400\r\nserver is running on the sport\r\n\r\n1412\r\n01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,719\r\nso this is all for the mqtt broker okay\r\n\r\n1413\r\n01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:32,559\r\nso we are calling our mqtt functions and\r\n\r\n1414\r\n01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:34,278\r\nalso in the web soet that will\r\n\r\n1415\r\n01:04:34,278 --> 01:04:36,239\r\ncommunicate between This Server and the\r\n\r\n1416\r\n01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:37,760\r\nclient the last thing that we will need\r\n\r\n1417\r\n01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,159\r\nto do is to go inside the public\r\n\r\n1418\r\n01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:42,880\r\ndirectory and create the two static\r\n\r\n1419\r\n01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,358\r\nfiles that we need the final part of our\r\n\r\n1420\r\n01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:48,039\r\nproject is the two HTML files the first\r\n\r\n1421\r\n01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:51,079\r\none is the graph. HTML file that will\r\n\r\n1422\r\n01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:53,400\r\ndisplay the graph for the temperature\r\n\r\n1423\r\n01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,679\r\npressure air quality and Li sensity and\r\n\r\n1424\r\n01:04:56,679 --> 01:05:00,880\r\nthe detail. ejs will display the saved\r\n\r\n1425\r\n01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,278\r\nsensor data that we will query from the\r\n\r\n1426\r\n01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:06,760\r\ndatabase so if we select to show the sav\r\n\r\n1427\r\n01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,719\r\nsensor data between the last 1 and 5\r\n\r\n1428\r\n01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:12,519\r\nhours this HTML file will be used to\r\n\r\n1429\r\n01:05:12,519 --> 01:05:14,519\r\ndisplay that data we will start with our\r\n\r\n1430\r\n01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:17,599\r\nnormal HTML tag I am assuming that you\r\n\r\n1431\r\n01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:19,960\r\nalready know how to write HTML this\r\n\r\n1432\r\n01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,599\r\nvideo is not really about building HTML\r\n\r\n1433\r\n01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:25,920\r\nwe decide to put some inline TSS you can\r\n\r\n1434\r\n01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,639\r\nalso choose to create a CSS file and put\r\n\r\n1435\r\n01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:30,719\r\nit there it doesn't really matter but\r\n\r\n1436\r\n01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:33,719\r\nmore importantly we scroll down and we\r\n\r\n1437\r\n01:05:33,719 --> 01:05:36,798\r\nadd circuit. now we come here and this\r\n\r\n1438\r\n01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:38,920\r\nis where we Define the header for the\r\n\r\n1439\r\n01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,358\r\nwebsite that is the iot home automation\r\n\r\n1440\r\n01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:44,400\r\nproject now we scroll down further and\r\n\r\n1441\r\n01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,798\r\nour dashboard start right here we can\r\n\r\n1442\r\n01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:50,639\r\nremove this space but at this point we\r\n\r\n1443\r\n01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:53,838\r\nDefine the four containers that display\r\n\r\n1444\r\n01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:56,559\r\nthe sensors in four different colors so\r\n\r\n1445\r\n01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,519\r\nthis container is showing the\r\n\r\n1446\r\n01:05:58,519 --> 01:06:00,920\r\ntemperature this is showing the pressure\r\n\r\n1447\r\n01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,199\r\nwe have the air quality right here and\r\n\r\n1448\r\n01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:05,798\r\nthe last container is showing light\r\n\r\n1449\r\n01:06:05,798 --> 01:06:07,960\r\nintensity control by the way this\r\n\r\n1450\r\n01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,719\r\ntemplate that we are using is from W3\r\n\r\n1451\r\n01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:14,199\r\nCSS template the HTML template is very\r\n\r\n1452\r\n01:06:14,199 --> 01:06:16,960\r\nvery simple to use now we scroll down\r\n\r\n1453\r\n01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,599\r\nhere we can see the graphical display of\r\n\r\n1454\r\n01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:22,400\r\nthe connected device this is the htmf\r\n\r\n1455\r\n01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,039\r\nfile that will be used to display the\r\n\r\n1456\r\n01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:28,000\r\ngraph of of each sensor as we showed in\r\n\r\n1457\r\n01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,159\r\nthe demo every sensor has its own\r\n\r\n1458\r\n01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:32,798\r\ngraphical display so as we are sending\r\n\r\n1459\r\n01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:34,960\r\nthe values from the server into the\r\n\r\n1460\r\n01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,400\r\nfront end every value that is received\r\n\r\n1461\r\n01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,039\r\nwill be displayed in the graph and also\r\n\r\n1462\r\n01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:42,278\r\nit will be shown in the part that\r\n\r\n1463\r\n01:06:42,278 --> 01:06:44,838\r\nrepresent the value now this script is\r\n\r\n1464\r\n01:06:44,838 --> 01:06:47,679\r\nfor displaying the graph so we first\r\n\r\n1465\r\n01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,318\r\nDefine values for the four temperature\r\n\r\n1466\r\n01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:53,318\r\nsensors and also as we saw in the demo\r\n\r\n1467\r\n01:06:53,318 --> 01:06:55,798\r\nwe display the time and sensor values so\r\n\r\n1468\r\n01:06:55,798 --> 01:06:58,079\r\nright here we are kind of getting the\r\n\r\n1469\r\n01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:00,480\r\ncurrent time for the graph we use the\r\n\r\n1470\r\n01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,079\r\nplotly library if you don't know about\r\n\r\n1471\r\n01:07:03,079 --> 01:07:05,119\r\nthe plotly library it makes plotting\r\n\r\n1472\r\n01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:07,519\r\ngraphs very easy so all that we have to\r\n\r\n1473\r\n01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:10,079\r\ndo is that we need to define the graph\r\n\r\n1474\r\n01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:13,159\r\nfor whatever variable so this graph is\r\n\r\n1475\r\n01:07:13,159 --> 01:07:15,358\r\ndefined for the temperature we Define\r\n\r\n1476\r\n01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:17,679\r\nfor the pressure right here so we say on\r\n\r\n1477\r\n01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:20,679\r\nthe x axis will be time and on the Y AIS\r\n\r\n1478\r\n01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:22,358\r\nwill be the value that we want to\r\n\r\n1479\r\n01:07:22,358 --> 01:07:25,239\r\nrepresent so we do it for the rest of\r\n\r\n1480\r\n01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:27,880\r\nthe variables the update plot function\r\n\r\n1481\r\n01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,318\r\nperforms a crucial role here because as\r\n\r\n1482\r\n01:07:30,318 --> 01:07:32,400\r\nwe receive values from the server we\r\n\r\n1483\r\n01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,798\r\nneed to update the HTML file so we have\r\n\r\n1484\r\n01:07:35,798 --> 01:07:38,159\r\nthis function that does that we start\r\n\r\n1485\r\n01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:40,880\r\nwith random values as usual but as we\r\n\r\n1486\r\n01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,119\r\nmove on WE update the variables that we\r\n\r\n1487\r\n01:07:44,119 --> 01:07:47,039\r\ncreated with the new values okay so when\r\n\r\n1488\r\n01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:49,119\r\nwe pass the data the data will be an\r\n\r\n1489\r\n01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,239\r\nobject and that object will have the\r\n\r\n1490\r\n01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:53,798\r\ntemperature pressure air quality and um\r\n\r\n1491\r\n01:07:53,798 --> 01:07:56,760\r\nlight intensity FS so we update it and\r\n\r\n1492\r\n01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,920\r\nin order to make the graph readable we\r\n\r\n1493\r\n01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,400\r\nonly show 20 points so what we do is\r\n\r\n1494\r\n01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,358\r\nthat if we get more values than that we\r\n\r\n1495\r\n01:08:04,358 --> 01:08:06,880\r\njust have to shift it that is why the\r\n\r\n1496\r\n01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,960\r\ngraph keeps on shifting to the left so\r\n\r\n1497\r\n01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,480\r\nafter doing that we will update each\r\n\r\n1498\r\n01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,798\r\npoint individually okay so we already\r\n\r\n1499\r\n01:08:14,798 --> 01:08:16,640\r\nhave the name of the graph then we will\r\n\r\n1500\r\n01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,000\r\nupdate it with the new and we do it for\r\n\r\n1501\r\n01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,640\r\nall the force in that was the script for\r\n\r\n1502\r\n01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,399\r\nupdating the plot now I have a script\r\n\r\n1503\r\n01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:28,198\r\nhere foring values from the back end now\r\n\r\n1504\r\n01:08:28,198 --> 01:08:30,798\r\nwe are using soet iio first we need to\r\n\r\n1505\r\n01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:33,640\r\ndeclare an object for the soet iio and\r\n\r\n1506\r\n01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,759\r\nthese are the four variables that we\r\n\r\n1507\r\n01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,399\r\nwill be dealing with that is the state\r\n\r\n1508\r\n01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:39,319\r\nof the sensor now the first function\r\n\r\n1509\r\n01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:41,838\r\nwe've declared here is the function to\r\n\r\n1510\r\n01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:45,039\r\nhandle the check B change as we saw in\r\n\r\n1511\r\n01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:47,960\r\nthe demo we can choose to switch on or\r\n\r\n1512\r\n01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,560\r\noff a particular sensor so we use this\r\n\r\n1513\r\n01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,798\r\nfunction to deal with that and whenever\r\n\r\n1514\r\n01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:55,600\r\na click happen we emit the sensor value\r\n\r\n1515\r\n01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,158\r\nand also the sensor data and it will be\r\n\r\n1516\r\n01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:00,560\r\nreceived at the back end via the soet\r\n\r\n1517\r\n01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,600\r\niio now right here you can see we are\r\n\r\n1518\r\n01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,520\r\njust adding event listener so that we\r\n\r\n1519\r\n01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,238\r\ncan change the value of which checkbox\r\n\r\n1520\r\n01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:10,960\r\nwas clicked or selected now after doing\r\n\r\n1521\r\n01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,960\r\nthat here we can see we have defined a\r\n\r\n1522\r\n01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:17,359\r\ncircuit iio parameter here if sensor\r\n\r\n1523\r\n01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,798\r\ndata is emitted from the server this\r\n\r\n1524\r\n01:09:19,798 --> 01:09:21,960\r\ncircuit will receive it we will set the\r\n\r\n1525\r\n01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,759\r\nvalues and we also update the plot and\r\n\r\n1526\r\n01:09:24,759 --> 01:09:27,039\r\nwe defined the set values here when we\r\n\r\n1527\r\n01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:29,198\r\npass when we pass the data to this\r\n\r\n1528\r\n01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,838\r\nfunction what it does it goes and gets\r\n\r\n1529\r\n01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:35,759\r\nthe HTML Elements by their IDs and it\r\n\r\n1530\r\n01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:38,920\r\nwill pass the respective data values in\r\n\r\n1531\r\n01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,920\r\nhere that will be all for the graph.\r\n\r\n1532\r\n01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:44,238\r\nHTML let's quickly look at detail. ejs\r\n\r\n1533\r\n01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:46,319\r\nnow maybe you might be wondering why we\r\n\r\n1534\r\n01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:49,798\r\nare using ejs ejs allows us to embed\r\n\r\n1535\r\n01:09:49,798 --> 01:09:52,600\r\ndata into the HTML file as usual we need\r\n\r\n1536\r\n01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,520\r\nto include the soet I object now here is\r\n\r\n1537\r\n01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,560\r\nwhere we Define the headers now this is\r\n\r\n1538\r\n01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,399\r\nwhere we Define the radio buttons just\r\n\r\n1539\r\n01:10:01,399 --> 01:10:03,800\r\nright next to the search input button\r\n\r\n1540\r\n01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,760\r\nyou can see we have options to choose\r\n\r\n1541\r\n01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,000\r\nthe time interval in which you want to\r\n\r\n1542\r\n01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,039\r\ncarry sensor data when you click it it\r\n\r\n1543\r\n01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:13,119\r\nwill show you whether you want to query\r\n\r\n1544\r\n01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:16,119\r\ndata in minutes hours days or years and\r\n\r\n1545\r\n01:10:16,119 --> 01:10:19,439\r\nthis is the placeholder for the the time\r\n\r\n1546\r\n01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:21,800\r\nrange in which we want to carry the data\r\n\r\n1547\r\n01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,079\r\nand we have defined the button here the\r\n\r\n1548\r\n01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:26,960\r\nrest are simple HTM ml file now this is\r\n\r\n1549\r\n01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,198\r\nwhere we use our ejs so the values that\r\n\r\n1550\r\n01:10:30,198 --> 01:10:33,600\r\nwe will receive we can pass to this htmf\r\n\r\n1551\r\n01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,119\r\nfile obviously it's an object that\r\n\r\n1552\r\n01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:38,760\r\ncontains the time stamp that we recorded\r\n\r\n1553\r\n01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,719\r\nit contains the temperature pressure and\r\n\r\n1554\r\n01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:43,479\r\nO quality we open the tax because we are\r\n\r\n1555\r\n01:10:43,479 --> 01:10:46,039\r\ndealing with tables we have the row here\r\n\r\n1556\r\n01:10:46,039 --> 01:10:48,319\r\nand we have the table data so we pass\r\n\r\n1557\r\n01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,840\r\nthem here and that will be pretty much\r\n\r\n1558\r\n01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,760\r\nthe HTML file but when we scroll down\r\n\r\n1559\r\n01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,679\r\nhere so here in the d. ejs we define\r\n\r\n1560\r\n01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:00,520\r\nsoet iio object the server will emit on\r\n\r\n1561\r\n01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,439\r\nthis name so the soet iio is waiting on\r\n\r\n1562\r\n01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:05,760\r\nthis so when it catches it it will pass\r\n\r\n1563\r\n01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,760\r\nthe database to this function Right add\r\n\r\n1564\r\n01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,800\r\nsensor content and this function\r\n\r\n1565\r\n01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,119\r\nobviously is going to update the HTML\r\n\r\n1566\r\n01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:15,439\r\nfile to the function ad sensor content\r\n\r\n1567\r\n01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:18,119\r\nfirst it receives data from the back end\r\n\r\n1568\r\n01:11:18,119 --> 01:11:21,279\r\nand it creates a new HTML element and\r\n\r\n1569\r\n01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:24,000\r\ncall it t body right so that is a table\r\n\r\n1570\r\n01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,840\r\nbody and it gives it an ID here and\r\n\r\n1571\r\n01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,279\r\nbecause it is an array you know we carry\r\n\r\n1572\r\n01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:31,079\r\nit from the database so it contains\r\n\r\n1573\r\n01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:33,600\r\ncouple of data it will Loop through each\r\n\r\n1574\r\n01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,880\r\nof them first it it creates a TD element\r\n\r\n1575\r\n01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,319\r\nfor each and it will append elements to\r\n\r\n1576\r\n01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:42,198\r\nthe TD elements and it will then append\r\n\r\n1577\r\n01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:45,238\r\nit to the table row element after that\r\n\r\n1578\r\n01:11:45,238 --> 01:11:48,880\r\nvery simple it appends the TR to the\r\n\r\n1579\r\n01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,359\r\ntable body that should be all when we\r\n\r\n1580\r\n01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:54,520\r\nscroll up a little bit we also Define a\r\n\r\n1581\r\n01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,520\r\nfunction for for the search button so\r\n\r\n1582\r\n01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,520\r\nafter you have typed the type range in\r\n\r\n1583\r\n01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:01,000\r\nwhich you want to carry the sensor data\r\n\r\n1584\r\n01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,198\r\nthis is how we are dealing with it first\r\n\r\n1585\r\n01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:05,479\r\nwe get the input of the time range you\r\n\r\n1586\r\n01:12:05,479 --> 01:12:08,319\r\nhave typed right so if you type 1 comma\r\n\r\n1587\r\n01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:11,198\r\n5 so we are splitting it into two so\r\n\r\n1588\r\n01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:13,279\r\nfirst we'll get the time start and the\r\n\r\n1589\r\n01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:15,880\r\ntime end after doing that we combine it\r\n\r\n1590\r\n01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:18,198\r\ninto an object and we will pass this to\r\n\r\n1591\r\n01:12:18,198 --> 01:12:20,719\r\nthe back end when we took a look at the\r\n\r\n1592\r\n01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:23,639\r\nback end code the circuit Doon is also\r\n\r\n1593\r\n01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:25,760\r\nwaiting on this when it gets it it goes\r\n\r\n1594\r\n01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,719\r\nthrough the database and it will fetch\r\n\r\n1595\r\n01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:30,119\r\nthe data according to the time start and\r\n\r\n1596\r\n01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:32,439\r\nthe time end basically that is the end\r\n\r\n1597\r\n01:12:32,439 --> 01:12:35,600\r\nof the two HTML files they are very easy\r\n\r\n1598\r\n01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,560\r\nfiles and this brings us to the end of\r\n\r\n1599\r\n01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:42,119\r\nthe iot project I hope you had fun and I\r\n\r\n1600\r\n01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:44,198\r\nhoped you learned something I am

--> 00:02:20,239\r\nmoney for but it's pretty cheap the\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,519\r\ndomain name usually costs between $10\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,360\r\nand $20 per

some\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,639\r\nmoney on this we'll be getting our\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,878\r\ndomain and our hosting through hostinger\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:40,598\r\nhostinger sponsored this video and\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:42,959\r\nbesides using them for this video I've\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,519\r\nalso used them personally and I found\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,719\r\nthat they're are a very good hosting\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:50,080\r\nprovider so we can go to hostinger.com\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,598\r\nand if we scroll down we can see the\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:55,158\r\ndifferent plans I'm just going to go\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:57,719\r\nwith the premium the cheapest plan if we\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,280\r\ngo down here we can see what what it\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,400\r\ncomes with\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400\r\nand pretty much all of them come with a\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,360\r\nfree domain which we're going to be\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,639\r\nusing and this cheaper plan has 100\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:10,519\r\ngigabyte SSD storage whereas with the\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,479\r\nmore expensive plans you get the 200\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,840\r\ngabt and there's a few other better\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,959\r\nthings about the more expensive plans\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,680\r\nfor what we're doing this one's going to\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,080\r\nwork fine so I'll choose the plan and\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,799\r\nthen you have to choose the period And\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,479\r\ndepending on the period you're going to\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,120\r\nget different discounts so the more\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,560\r\nmonths you get it the cheaper it will be\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,759\r\nper month so the 12 month and the 24mth\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,598\r\nare both $2.99 so you just choose what's\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:40,519\r\ngoing to work best for you and then go\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:42,680\r\nto continue and then you can go through\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,318\r\nand con and create the account and go\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:47,719\r\nthrough purchasing the plan when you\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,959\r\nfirst create an account it should go\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:52,719\r\nstraight into guiding you to create your\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,199\r\nfirst website but if not you can go to\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,919\r\nthe homepage on the dashboard and we'll\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,280\r\njust continue creating\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,759\r\na site so now we just have to go through\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,878\r\nthis I'm going to skip a lot of this but\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,799\r\nI'm going to say create a website and we\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,719\r\nknow it's going to be a WordPress site\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,840\r\nand then we want to remember our\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,279\r\nWordPress admin mail and password\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,358\r\nbecause we're going to need that later\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,918\r\nso click next and we're just going to\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:23,639\r\ncreate a blank site and here's where\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,560\r\nwe're going to create a our domain name\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,439\r\nso through our plan we get a free domain\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,879\r\nname and this site is going to be called\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,720\r\nis it Monday today.com our whole website\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,199\r\nis about finding out if it's Monday\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,560\r\ntoday now obviously your website is\r\n\r\n107\r\n00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,199\r\ngoing to be probably something different\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,959\r\nI just thought I'd do something kind of\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,639\r\nfun for this demonstration and we'll be\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,800\r\nable to demonstrate all the key parts of\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,360\r\ncreating a website using WordPress and\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,560\r\nthe first website I'm trying worked but\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,720\r\nthat's because I already tested to make\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,879\r\nsure this was available it could take a\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,959\r\nfew tries to find a website URL that\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,639\r\nhasn't been taken yet so I'll go with\r\n\r\n117\r\n00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,560\r\nnext okay now we are going to have to\r\n\r\n118\r\n00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,800\r\nselect a Data Center and so the data\r\n\r\n119\r\n00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,160\r\ncenter is basically where our website is\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,399\r\ngoing to be hosted and you want to it's\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,839\r\nbetter for it to be hosted closest to\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,519\r\nwhere our audience is going to be\r\n\r\n123\r\n00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,399\r\nhowever people can still access the\r\n\r\n124\r\n00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,800\r\nwebsite from anywhere in the world so\r\n\r\n125\r\n00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,038\r\nthis one is closest to where I live in\r\n\r\n126\r\n00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,038\r\nMichigan so that's the one I will choose\r\n\r\n127\r\n00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:35,079\r\nnow we just wait for WordPress to be\r\n\r\n128\r\n00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:39,000\r\ninstalled and you can install WordPress\r\n\r\n129\r\n00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,399\r\non most hosting providers and the way\r\n\r\n130\r\n00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,399\r\nyou install WordPress is going to be a\r\n\r\n131\r\n00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,918\r\nlittle different but once WordPress is\r\n\r\n132\r\n00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:49,639\r\ninstalled the way you set up and build\r\n\r\n133\r\n00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,680\r\nyour web WordPress website is going to\r\n\r\n134\r\n00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,399\r\nbe basically the same no matter what\r\n\r\n135\r\n00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,360\r\nyour hosting provider is okay we're now\r\n\r\n136\r\n00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,240\r\nin the WordPress\r\n\r\n137\r\n00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,519\r\ndashboard the administrator page now\r\n\r\n138\r\n00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,560\r\nthis is a special section just for\r\n\r\n139\r\n00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,839\r\nhostinger if you're hosting in a\r\n\r\n140\r\n00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,279\r\ndifferent place it's not you're not\r\n\r\n141\r\n00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,598\r\ngoing to have this hostinger onboarding\r\n\r\n142\r\n00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:14,478\r\nbut one cool thing about hostinger is\r\n\r\n143\r\n00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:17,720\r\nthat you do get the AI content creator\r\n\r\n144\r\n00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,120\r\nthat can help you create content for\r\n\r\n145\r\n00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,519\r\nyour website we'll be talking more about\r\n\r\n146\r\n00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:25,360\r\nthat later for now let's make sure we\r\n\r\n147\r\n00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,800\r\nget our URL correct or our domain name\r\n\r\n148\r\n00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,478\r\ncuz right now it says it's at preview\r\n\r\n149\r\n00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:35,879\r\ndomain.com but we want to to connect our\r\n\r\n150\r\n00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:38,639\r\nactual domain so I'm going to so I'm\r\n\r\n151\r\n00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,000\r\ngoing to click connect a domain and it's\r\n\r\n152\r\n00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,519\r\ngoing to say that you connect H panel\r\n\r\n153\r\n00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,120\r\nand you may have to waake up to 24 hours\r\n\r\n154\r\n00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,279\r\nuntil the domain fully connects so let's\r\n\r\n155\r\n00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,279\r\nstart by going over to H panel this is\r\n\r\n156\r\n00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,478\r\nbasically the hostinger administrator\r\n\r\n157\r\n00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,759\r\npage so we have our hostinger admin page\r\n\r\n158\r\n00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,000\r\nand we have our WordPress admin page so\r\n\r\n159\r\n00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,800\r\nlet's take a look at the hosting or\r\n\r\n160\r\n00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,079\r\nadmin page before we go deep into\r\n\r\n161\r\n00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,959\r\nWordPress so you can see it's saying the\r\n\r\n162\r\n00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,439\r\ndomain is connecting it may take up to\r\n\r\n163\r\n00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,000\r\nan hour but while this is connecting we\r\n\r\n164\r\n00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,720\r\ncan set up some things right from here\r\n\r\n165\r\n00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,560\r\nso we're going to have to set up our\r\n\r\n166\r\n00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,560\r\nemail on our domain from the hosting or\r\n\r\n167\r\n00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,399\r\nadmin page or the H panel page so I'm\r\n\r\n168\r\n00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,879\r\ngoing to go to emails and we get a free\r\n\r\n169\r\n00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:33,199\r\nemail service so I'll just click set up\r\n\r\n170\r\n00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,240\r\nnow we can get some additional stuff\r\n\r\n171\r\n00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240\r\nwith this business starter email but\r\n\r\n172\r\n00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,519\r\nwe're just going to use the free email\r\n\r\n173\r\n00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,800\r\nservice and we're going to set up on is\r\n\r\n174\r\n00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,360\r\nit Monday today.com\r\n\r\n175\r\n00:07:43,360 -->

it\r\n\r\n180\r\n00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,360\r\nwe're going to be in the browser but\r\n\r\n181\r\n00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,519\r\nlet's just skip this section right here\r\n\r\n182\r\n00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,959\r\nand before we can finish sing up the\r\n\r\n183\r\n00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:08,399\r\nemail we do have to verify our email for\r\n\r\n184\r\n00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,158\r\nour

00:09:48,879\r\nemail setup the backups automatically\r\n\r\n218\r\n00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,679\r\nare for daily and so now we can just go\r\n\r\n219\r\n00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:56,839\r\nto the WordPress\r\n\r\n220\r\n00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,200\r\nadmin and if we look at the URL we see\r\n\r\n221\r\n00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,480\r\nnow we have the correct URL is it Monday\r\n\r\n222\r\n00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,039\r\ntoday.com and now we can get to the\r\n\r\n223\r\n00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,278\r\nWordPress admin page without even\r\n\r\n224\r\n00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:11,000\r\nlogging into hostinger we don't have to\r\n\r\n225\r\n00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,480\r\njust go and click this WordPress admin\r\n\r\n226\r\n00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,919\r\nbutton we can actually go to the URL\r\n\r\n227\r\n00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,879\r\ndirectly now I'm going to delete this\r\n\r\n228\r\n00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:24,240\r\nand now if we just go to isit monday.com\r\n\r\n229\r\n00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,480\r\nwp-admin WP stands for WordPress and\r\n\r\n230\r\n00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,159\r\nadmin is just the the admin page so this\r\n\r\n231\r\n00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:32,958\r\nis how we can get to our WordPress admin\r\n\r\n232\r\n00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,879\r\npage and then we would have to log in\r\n\r\n233\r\n00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:38,360\r\nI'm already logged in but after you get\r\n\r\n234\r\n00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,759\r\nlogged in then we can update our\r\n\r\n235\r\n00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:43,078\r\nWordPress page and customize it from\r\n\r\n236\r\n00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:45,799\r\nhere I'll zoom in a bit so we can still\r\n\r\n237\r\n00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:49,879\r\nget back to the hostinger admin page but\r\n\r\n238\r\n00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:53,559\r\nwe're just going to go right to the main\r\n\r\n239\r\n00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:56,360\r\nWordPress dashboard right now so this is\r\n\r\n240\r\n00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,320\r\nwhat you're going to see no matter who\r\n\r\n241\r\n00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,600\r\nyou're hosting provider is so once we're\r\n\r\n242\r\n00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,039\r\non the dashboard we can pop over to our\r\n\r\n243\r\n00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:09,519\r\nwebsite and this is our website pretty\r\n\r\n244\r\n00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,399\r\nsparse not exactly what we want but\r\n\r\n245\r\n00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,759\r\nwe're going to fix that and you see this\r\n\r\n246\r\n00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,000\r\nblack bar at the top we can only see\r\n\r\n247\r\n00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,480\r\nthat because we're logged in to the\r\n\r\n248\r\n00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,078\r\nadmin page the users uh of the website\r\n\r\n249\r\n00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:25,759\r\nother view viewers will not see this\r\n\r\n250\r\n00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,240\r\nblack bar and now I can click here again\r\n\r\n251\r\n00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,399\r\nto go back to the dashboard so now we\r\n\r\n252\r\n00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,639\r\ncan start setting things up first I'm\r\n\r\n253\r\n00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:36,200\r\ngoing to go to the the settings and\r\n\r\n254\r\n00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,679\r\nwe're just going to do some basic\r\n\r\n255\r\n00:11:38,679 -->

theme\r\n\r\n342\r\n00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,639\r\nand it works perfectly with Elementor so\r\n\r\n343\r\n00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,919\r\nwe can go into like this information\r\n\r\n344\r\n00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,360\r\npage but I'm just going to click install\r\n\r\n345\r\n00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,240\r\nand\r\n\r\n346\r\n00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,278\r\nactivate so to get a website up and run\r\n\r\n347\r\n00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,039\r\nreally quick I like to use a template so\r\n\r\n348\r\n00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:06,360\r\nI went to Astra here that's the theme we\r\n\r\n349\r\n00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,679\r\njust added and I'm going to go to\r\n\r\n350\r\n00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:15,198\r\nstarter templates and then install and\r\n\r\n351\r\n00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,120\r\nactivate and I'm just going to use a\r\n\r\n352\r\n00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,278\r\ntemplate here and we're using\r\n\r\n353\r\n00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:24,639\r\nElementor we don't need to use the AI\r\n\r\n354\r\n00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,078\r\nBuilder now we can see that there's all\r\n\r\n355\r\n00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:29,480\r\nthese different\r\n\r\n356\r\n00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,078\r\ntemplates and we can actually choose any\r\n\r\n357\r\n00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:35,879\r\nof these templates so we want to go\r\n\r\n358\r\n00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:39,318\r\nthrough and look at which website looks\r\n\r\n359\r\n00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:41,958\r\nclosest to the one that we want to\r\n\r\n360\r\n00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,360\r\ncreate so you can look at all these\r\n\r\n361\r\n00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,720\r\ntemplates and depending on the type of\r\n\r\n362\r\n00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,919\r\nsite you're creating you'll be wanting\r\n\r\n363\r\n00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:51,958\r\nto use a different template so we can\r\n\r\n364\r\n00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,879\r\nsearch through all these but I'm going\r\n\r\n365\r\n00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,600\r\nto go up to the\r\n\r\n366\r\n00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,360\r\ntop and just and remember any of these\r\n\r\n367\r\n00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,318\r\nwe can customize and we definitely are\r\n\r\n368\r\n00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:01,480\r\ngoing to\r\n\r\n369\r\n00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,880\r\ncustomize I kind of like this one we\r\n\r\n370\r\n00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,318\r\nhaven't we haven't used it yet we're\r\n\r\n371\r\n00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,558\r\njust looking at\r\n\r\n372\r\n00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:16,199\r\nit and yeah this looks pretty nice now\r\n\r\n373\r\n00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,720\r\nwe can start to customize it even here\r\n\r\n374\r\n00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,078\r\nbefore we select it uh so obviously we\r\n\r\n375\r\n00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:25,400\r\ncan customize it even more once we\r\n\r\n376\r\n00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,078\r\ninstall the template but I can change\r\n\r\n377\r\n00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,200\r\nthe font and I kind of like this one\r\n\r\n378\r\n00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,679\r\nhere we can change the color palette

later\r\n\r\n381\r\n00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:43,200\r\nand then click continue and now we can\r\n\r\n382\r\n00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,160\r\nchoose if we want to add any extra\r\n\r\n383\r\n00:17:45,160

--> 00:20:58,240\r\nactually kind of change the size of the\r\n\r\n450\r\n00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,400\r\nwe can change the size of the logo with\r\n\r\n451\r\n00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,359\r\nthis here we'll make it smaller like\r\n\r\n452\r\n00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:07,720\r\nthat okay now that we have the logo done\r\n\r\n453\r\n00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,759\r\nthat we like I'm just going to click\r\n\r\n454\r\n00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,480\r\npublish to basically save that logo so\r\n\r\n455\r\n00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,400\r\nthere are different ways to edit\r\n\r\n456\r\n00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,159\r\ndifferent parts of the page so I just\r\n\r\n457\r\n00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:19,759\r\nshowed you the the customize button\r\n\r\n458\r\n00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,159\r\nwhere it's going to um change some stuff\r\n\r\n459\r\n00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:25,440\r\nbut you can see I cannot change this\r\n\r\n460\r\n00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,960\r\npart of the page to change this part of\r\n\r\n461\r\n00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,079\r\nthe page we going to have to use\r\n\r\n462\r\n00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,839\r\nElementor so basically if there's stuff\r\n\r\n463\r\n00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:35,798\r\nthat's the same on every page like this\r\n\r\n464\r\n00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:38,798\r\nmenu could be the same on every page uh\r\n\r\n465\r\n00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,400\r\nthere could be a footer here this stuff\r\n\r\n466\r\n00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,919\r\nis does not use Elementor oh and there's\r\n\r\n467\r\n00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,519\r\none more logo here so let's update this\r\n\r\n468\r\n00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,400\r\nlogo and we'll insert our dark\r\n\r\n469\r\n00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,440\r\none and while we're here we can remove\r\n\r\n470\r\n00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,720\r\nthis we're going to be updating this\r\n\r\n471\r\n00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,640\r\nmore later so go back to\r\n\r\n472\r\n00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,119\r\npublish so the header and the footer are\r\n\r\n473\r\n00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:07,640\r\nwith customize but most of the page is\r\n\r\n474\r\n00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,079\r\ngoing to be with edit with Elementor so\r\n\r\n475\r\n00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,159\r\nthat's what we're going to go into now\r\n\r\n476\r\n00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,440\r\nedit with Elementor and this is where we\r\n\r\n477\r\n00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,079\r\ncan start making some real changes to\r\n\r\n478\r\n00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:19,400\r\nour page so we're going to start\r\n\r\n479\r\n00:22:19,400

structure\r\n\r\n482\r\n00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:29,519\r\nthing right here the structure can help\r\n\r\n483\r\n00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:32,759\r\nus access different parts of the page so\r\n\r\n484\r\n00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:36,159\r\nso we can change the text and we can\r\n\r\n485\r\n00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,159\r\nalso change a lot of other things about\r\n\r\n486\r\n00:22:38,159

there's a shadow um we can\r\n\r\n489\r\n00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:49,558\r\ngo Advanced and uh we can change the\r\n\r\n490\r\n00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:52,159\r\nmargin and just you know these pink\r\n\r\n491\r\n00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,159\r\nlines these are not going to display on\r\n\r\n492\r\n00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,839\r\nthe page those are just to help

--> 00:23:02,119\r\nall these different things that you can\r\n\r\n496\r\n00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,720\r\nchange about the text and the layout but\r\n\r\n497\r\n00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,000\r\nwhat I want to do is change this\r\n\r\n498\r\n00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,759\r\nbackground image so I'm going to click\r\n\r\n499\r\n00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:12,880\r\nthese six little dots right up here and\r\n\r\n500\r\n00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,919\r\nnow I can edit this container because we\r\n\r\n501\r\n00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,278\r\ndon't need an outdoor feel for this page\r\n\r\n502\r\n00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:22,119\r\nnow so go to style and now here is where\r\n\r\n503\r\n00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:26,079\r\nwe can choose a new\r\n\r\n504\r\n00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:28,519\r\nimage now I'm just going to upload a few\r\n\r\n505\r\n00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:32,480\r\nfiles that we'll use in our page now I\r\n\r\n506\r\n00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480\r\njust made these images cuz I thought\r\n\r\n507\r\n00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,038\r\nthey would kind of look nice for what we\r\n\r\n508\r\n00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:38,679\r\nwere going for in our page and I'm going\r\n\r\n509\r\n00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:42,400\r\nto select this this hero image so this\r\n\r\n510\r\n00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,519\r\nis like an abstract with like clocks and\r\n\r\n511\r\n00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:48,240\r\nstuff back here and it kind of I thought\r\n\r\n512\r\n00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240\r\nit kind of went with what we were doing\r\n\r\n513\r\n00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,480\r\nand later I'll show you how to actually\r\n\r\n514\r\n00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,798\r\nmake it dynamically say if it's Monday\r\n\r\n515\r\n00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:57,278\r\nor not but first let's learn more about\r\n\r\n516\r\n00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:00,839\r\nhow to make customizations to this\r\n\r\n517\r\n00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:03,000\r\npage so let's see how to make more\r\n\r\n518\r\n00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,839\r\nchanges on this page I'm going to scroll\r\n\r\n519\r\n00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:08,079\r\ndown and we're just going to make\r\n\r\n520\r\n00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,960\r\nadjustments to the different sections of\r\n\r\n521\r\n00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,919\r\nthe page to make it go along with our\r\n\r\n522\r\n00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:16,278\r\nplan for the page so our services I'm\r\n\r\n523\r\n00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:18,759\r\ngoing to change this to be\r\n\r\n524\r\n00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:21,960\r\nfeatures and then if I want I could\r\n\r\n525\r\n00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,480\r\nchange this so basically everything in\r\n\r\n526\r\n00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,038\r\nthe page we can click on and change over\r\n\r\n527\r\n00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:29,000\r\nhere so I can change the width\r\n\r\n528\r\n00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,798\r\nI can change the style I can change the\r\n\r\n529\r\n00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:34,880\r\nalignment I can add an element and then\r\n\r\n530\r\n00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,398\r\nyou can just go to the different\r\n\r\n531\r\n00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:38,278\r\nsections on the side here to change\r\n\r\n532\r\n00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:40,759\r\nevery single element now I'm going to\r\n\r\n533\r\n00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:44,038\r\nlook at these three columns now I\r\n\r\n534\r\n00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:45,759\r\nactually we could go through and and\r\n\r\n535\r\n00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:48,359\r\nchange each image and we could choose a\r\n\r\n536\r\n00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:51,200\r\nnew image and then we can go and change\r\n\r\n537\r\n00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,000\r\nall this text the text that we want to\r\n\r\n538\r\n00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,398\r\ndo I actually want to change this\r\n\r\n539\r\n00:24:56,398 --> 00:24:58,839\r\nsection so there are four column s\r\n\r\n540\r\n00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:01,759\r\ninstead of three so there's a few ways\r\n\r\n541\r\n00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,200\r\nto do this we can just right click and\r\n\r\n542\r\n00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,440\r\ndo add new container and then we'll see\r\n\r\n543\r\n00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,079\r\nthis container down here if we click\r\n\r\n544\r\n00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,038\r\nplus then we can actually select the\r\n\r\n545\r\n00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:16,319\r\nlayout like I could select this that\r\n\r\n546\r\n00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:18,679\r\nwe're going to do a grid and then I\r\n\r\n547\r\n00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:21,359\r\ncould change the number of columns I\r\n\r\n548\r\n00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,159\r\ncould change

by\r\n\r\n700\r\n00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:33,159\r\npressing command or control I or you can\r\n\r\n701\r\n00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,000\r\nrightclick somewhere and go to where it\r\n\r\n702\r\n00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,359\r\nsays structure and you can see we have a\r\n\r\n703\r\n00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:40,398\r\ncontainer and inside the container\r\n\r\n704\r\n00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:41,839\r\nthere's three headings in the text\r\n\r\n705\r\n00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:43,480\r\neditor so here's one heading two\r\n\r\n706\r\n00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,558\r\nheadings and the text editor and then\r\n\r\n707\r\n00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:47,759\r\nthis is a container you can see this one\r\n\r\n708\r\n00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,880\r\nthat has this container and it has each\r\n\r\n709\r\n00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,638\r\nsection so there's this container which\r\n\r\n710\r\n00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,599\r\nis right here so basically this is going\r\n\r\n711\r\n00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:57,319\r\nto be our entire the structure of our\r\n\r\n712\r\n00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:00,480\r\nentire site that so under this text\r\n\r\n713\r\n00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,679\r\neditor I want to add another section not\r\n\r\n714\r\n00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:07,000\r\na container so I'm going to click this\r\n\r\n715\r\n00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,119\r\nplus button right here so I'm going to\r\n\r\n716\r\n00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:12,519\r\nsearch for HTML and then add the HTML\r\n\r\n717\r\n00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:16,359\r\nwidget and then I can add custom HTML\r\n\r\n718\r\n00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:19,480\r\ncode HTML is beyond the scope of this\r\n\r\n719\r\n00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,519\r\ntutorial and for most websites you're\r\n\r\n720\r\n00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:24,839\r\nnot going to actually have to add custom\r\n\r\n721\r\n00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:27,278\r\ncode but if you want something Dynamic\r\n\r\n722\r\n00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:30,278\r\nit can help okay I just pasted in some\r\n\r\n723\r\n00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:32,839\r\ncode here and full disclosure I just use\r\n\r\n724\r\n00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:37,240\r\nan llm to create this code I did do some\r\n\r\n725\r\n00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,519\r\nminor modifications just to make sure it\r\n\r\n726\r\n00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,960\r\nlooked exactly how I wanted so if you\r\n\r\n727\r\n00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,440\r\nare new to HTML there's still options if\r\n\r\n728\r\n00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,440\r\nyou want to add something custom to your\r\n\r\n729\r\n00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,038\r\nsite you can just use an llm like chat\r\n\r\n730\r\n00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:52,960\r\njpt or something like that to create\r\n\r\n731\r\n00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,919\r\nthat so now let's uh see what it looks\r\n\r\n732\r\n00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,880\r\nlike so I'm going to go to view page I\r\n\r\n733\r\n00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,159\r\nalready clicked publish and is it

--> 00:34:07,200\r\nactually Thursday when I'm recording\r\n\r\n737\r\n00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,838\r\nthis but let's test what it would be\r\n\r\n738\r\n00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:12,039\r\nlike if it was Monday so let me go back\r\n\r\n739\r\n00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:13,199\r\nto\r\n\r\n740\r\n00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,440\r\nedit and if I go into this I can just\r\n\r\n741\r\n00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,159\r\nsay oh um it's looking for the if it's\r\n\r\n742\r\n00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,719\r\nthe first day of the week in this if\r\n\r\n743\r\n00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,679\r\nstatement well

and\r\n\r\n746\r\n00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,760\r\nthen we can see oh it says yes if it is\r\n\r\n747\r\n00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,480\r\nMonday okay now let's see how to make\r\n\r\n748\r\n00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,760\r\nsome additional modifications so let me\r\n\r\n749\r\n00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,599\r\ngo back to edit with Elementor and I\r\n\r\n750\r\n00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,559\r\ndon't need to be showing the structure\r\n\r\n751\r\n00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,480\r\nanymore I'm actually going to change\r\n\r\n752\r\n00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,519\r\nthis text to I thought about deleting\r\n\r\n753\r\n00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:47,000\r\nthe text but I'm just going to\r\n\r\n754\r\n00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,519\r\ndo a page that does what it\r\n\r\n755\r\n00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:56,639\r\nsays and I'm going to change the margin\r\n\r\n756\r\n00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,838\r\nso this lines up\r\n\r\n757\r\n00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:03,119\r\ndifferently okay this is looking pretty\r\n\r\n758\r\n00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,400\r\ngood now I'll change the code and fix it\r\n\r\n759\r\n00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,838\r\nso it's what it should be here so let's\r\n\r\n760\r\n00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:10,679\r\nsee what else we want to change on our\r\n\r\n761\r\n00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:13,679\r\npage one we're going to update this menu\r\n\r\n762\r\n00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,199\r\nso we'll have the an about page which\r\n\r\n763\r\n00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:18,280\r\nwe're going to make some modifications\r\n\r\n764\r\n00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,320\r\nto we in the services page we're going\r\n\r\n765\r\n00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,039\r\nto change to Monday memes and then we\r\n\r\n766\r\n00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,760\r\nwill have a contact page so let's update\r\n\r\n767\r\n00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,280\r\nthese sections of the page to update\r\n\r\n768\r\n00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,119\r\nthis menu it's going to be a little\r\n\r\n769\r\n00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:39,599\r\ndifferent so the top menu we don't edit\r\n\r\n770\r\n00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,119\r\nwith Elementor also we don't edit with\r\n\r\n771\r\n00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,440\r\ncustomize so\r\n\r\n772\r\n00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,639\r\ncustomize we can change different\r\n\r\n773\r\n00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:50,159\r\nsections about the header but we can't\r\n\r\n774\r\n00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:52,639\r\nactually change the list of items in\r\n\r\n775\r\n00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:55,880\r\nthis header because this is just its own\r\n\r\n776\r\n00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,519\r\nsection called a primary menu where it\r\n\r\n777\r\n00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:59,838\r\nsay says home about Services contact\r\n\r\n778\r\n00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:03,318\r\nthat is the primary menu so there's a\r\n\r\n779\r\n00:36:03,318 --> 00:36:06,000\r\nfew ways to edit this menu we can click\r\n\r\n780\r\n00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,960\r\nconfigure menu from here and then we're\r\n\r\n781\r\n00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,838\r\non the main menu right here we can do\r\n\r\n782\r\n00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:13,358\r\nedit menu and then we can change things\r\n\r\n783\r\n00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:16,838\r\non here but a more common way to use it\r\n\r\n784\r\n00:36:16,838 --> 00:36:19,358\r\nthat gives you a little more features\r\n\r\n785\r\n00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:21,760\r\nand a little more options is to use the\r\n\r\n786\r\n00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,119\r\nWordPress admin page so I'm just going\r\n\r\n787\r\n00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,318\r\nto go to this WordPress\r\n\r\n788\r\n00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:33,199\r\ndashboard and we are going to update the\r\n\r\n789\r\n00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:35,800\r\nmenu so I'm going to go\r\n\r\n790\r\n00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,838\r\nto appearance and then\r\n\r\n791\r\n00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:42,719\r\nmenus and then we can change the\r\n\r\n792\r\n00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:45,119\r\ndifferent menus in this case the main\r\n\r\n793\r\n00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,920\r\nmenu if we want we can actually move\r\n\r\n794\r\n00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,358\r\nthis stuff around so it'll be home\r\n\r\n795\r\n00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:53,039\r\nservices about contact and this is going\r\n\r\n796\r\n00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:55,880\r\nto change the order we can also add\r\n\r\n797\r\n00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,199\r\nitems if we had other Pages we could add\r\n\r\n798\r\n00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,039\r\nto the menu and I'm actually going to\r\n\r\n799\r\n00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:05,000\r\ncreate another page that I can add to\r\n\r\n800\r\n00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000\r\nthe menu first of all we'll just save\r\n\r\n801\r\n00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000\r\nthis so we made that change and I'm\r\n\r\n802\r\n00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,679\r\ngoing to go to Pages now posts is when\r\n\r\n803\r\n00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,559\r\nyou're going to add or modify blog posts\r\n\r\n804\r\n00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:19,480\r\nbut we're going to be dealing with Pages\r\n\r\n805\r\n00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,480\r\nhere so here are all the pages that we\r\n\r\n806\r\n00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,719\r\nalready have in our our website and this\r\n\r\n807\r\n00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:29,920\r\nServices page we're not going to have a\r\n\r\n808\r\n00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,159\r\nServices page now I could just edit this\r\n\r\n809\r\n00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:35,880\r\nand change the title to the page we want\r\n\r\n810\r\n00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,039\r\nwhich is going to be me Monday memes but\r\n\r\n811\r\n00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:41,838\r\nthere we can also just delete this page\r\n\r\n812\r\n00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:43,480\r\nand add a new one which is what I'm\r\n\r\n813\r\n00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,559\r\ngoing to do I'm just going to click\r\n\r\n814\r\n00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:48,679\r\ntrash and so we've deleted that page now\r\n\r\n815\r\n00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:51,199\r\nI can add a new\r\n\r\n816\r\n00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:55,400\r\npage so just go to the top add new page\r\n\r\n817\r\n00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,838\r\nand then we can see a WordPress editor\r\n\r\n818\r\n00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:04,039\r\nright within the page so there's a few\r\n\r\n819\r\n00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:08,119\r\ndifferent editors you can use within\r\n\r\n820\r\n00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,639\r\nWordPress so this is the block editor we\r\n\r\n821\r\n00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:15,159\r\nalso have the Elementor editor so we can\r\n\r\n822\r\n00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,960\r\njust go through this and this will kind\r\n\r\n823\r\n00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,199\r\nof show you how to use the block editor\r\n\r\n824\r\n00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:22,559\r\nand we can add different blocks you can\r\n\r\n825\r\n00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:25,280\r\nkind of choose how you want to actually\r\n\r\n826\r\n00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,000\r\ncreate the page you want to use this\r\n\r\n827\r\n00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,039\r\nblock\r\n\r\n828\r\n00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,760\r\nor we can just click the edit with\r\n\r\n829\r\n00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,119\r\nElementor and we can use the way that\r\n\r\n830\r\n00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,838\r\nwe've already been making Pages before\r\n\r\n831\r\n00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:38,719\r\nwhich we are going to edit this page but\r\n\r\n832\r\n00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,679\r\nfirst let's go back because we want to\r\n\r\n833\r\n00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:43,159\r\nmake sure we put the add in the title of\r\n\r\n834\r\n00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:45,639\r\nthe page so I'm going go to these three\r\n\r\n835\r\n00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:51,559\r\nlittle dots rename and put Monday\r\n\r\n836\r\n00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,719\r\nmemes automatically updates the link to\r\n\r\n837\r\n00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:59,280\r\nMonday memes and so I'm going to publish\r\n\r\n838\r\n00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,119\r\nit so I basically save the um the what\r\n\r\n839\r\n00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:06,079\r\nwe've done so far but I'm also going to\r\n\r\n840\r\n00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,440\r\ngo to edit with Elementor and now we can\r\n\r\n841\r\n00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,239\r\nadd different sections so we're going to\r\n\r\n842\r\n00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:13,519\r\nadd a heading which is just going to be\r\n\r\n843\r\n00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:16,960\r\ncalled Monday\r\n\r\n844\r\n00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,519\r\nmemes and then I'm going to add a\r\n\r\n845\r\n00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:22,719\r\nsection here I'm going to hit plus and\r\n\r\n846\r\n00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:24,639\r\nwe can choose whether we want Grid or\r\n\r\n847\r\n00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:28,318\r\nFlex box so we're going to add Flex box\r\n\r\n848\r\n00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:31,679\r\nuh flexbox is going to work a little\r\n\r\n849\r\n00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,559\r\nbetter for different types of devices\r\n\r\n850\r\n00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:37,559\r\nit's going to be more responsive so\r\n\r\n851\r\n00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:40,239\r\nwhether someone has a mobile device or a\r\n\r\n852\r\n00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:43,920\r\ndesktop device will still look good and\r\n\r\n853\r\n00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,679\r\nI'm just going to add this where there's\r\n\r\n854\r\n00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:48,760\r\nfour different sections that we can put\r\n\r\n855\r\n00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,159\r\nsomething and we're just going to put an\r\n\r\n856\r\n00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:55,599\r\nimage in each one so I'm going to add an\r\n\r\n857\r\n00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,400\r\nimage and I'll upload the\r\n\r\n858\r\n00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,480\r\nfiles and then I'm just going to addit\r\n\r\n859\r\n00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,920\r\nthe different image in each one and when\r\n\r\n860\r\n00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,960\r\nyou're adding an image it's often good\r\n\r\n861\r\n00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,519\r\nto put an ALT text so this will appear\r\n\r\n862\r\n00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:12,760\r\nfor screen readers or screen readers\r\n\r\n863\r\n00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,960\r\nwill read the alt text if someone's uh\r\n\r\n864\r\n00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,239\r\ncan't actually see the image but also if\r\n\r\n865\r\n00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:20,480\r\nthe image doesn't load it can show the\r\n\r\n866\r\n00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,000\r\nalt text and so it's just good to add\r\n\r\n867\r\n00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,119\r\nalt text for each image that you add\r\n\r\n868\r\n00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:30,400\r\nso say it's a meme saying it's Monday\r\n\r\n869\r\n00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,440\r\nagain whoops that's not where we wanted\r\n\r\n870\r\n00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,000\r\nto put it but that's okay it's super\r\n\r\n871\r\n00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,920\r\neasy to delete it and actually I'm\r\n\r\n872\r\n00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,719\r\nsupposed to just drag it right into here\r\n\r\n873\r\n00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:40,480\r\nso I just drag the image right into this\r\n\r\n874\r\n00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,760\r\nspot so let's just quickly do it again\r\n\r\n875\r\n00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,480\r\nand luckily the alt text stays there\r\n\r\n876\r\n00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,880\r\nbecause it's going to be the same alt\r\n\r\n877\r\n00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,760\r\ntext no matter how often we put this\r\n\r\n878\r\n00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,719\r\nimage in\r\n\r\n879\r\n00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,800\r\nhere okay now I'm just going to add\r\n\r\n880\r\n00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,960\r\nimages for the rest of\r\n\r\n881\r\n00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,760\r\nthese okay got this page created so I\r\n\r\n882\r\n00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,199\r\ncan click publish and one thing if we go\r\n\r\n883\r\n00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:05,280\r\nto view page we can see the page Monday\r\n\r\n884\r\n00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,280\r\nmemes and it has the different images we\r\n\r\n885\r\n00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,239\r\njust added but one problem is we don't\r\n\r\n886\r\n00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:15,079\r\nsee it within our menu uh one thing we\r\n\r\n887\r\n00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:17,679\r\nknow notice about our menu is that it no\r\n\r\n888\r\n00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:19,838\r\nlonger says Services because we related\r\n\r\n889\r\n00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:22,480\r\nservices but it doesn't have the meme\r\n\r\n890\r\n00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,400\r\npage so let's add that also we can see\r\n\r\n891\r\n00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,280\r\nthat um it's showing the old logo here\r\n\r\n892\r\n00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,079\r\nso let's get all that fixed so I'm going\r\n\r\n893\r\n00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:34,358\r\nto close this window for now we'll go to\r\n\r\n894\r\n00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:37,838\r\nexit to Wordpress and now we can go back\r\n\r\n895\r\n00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:40,400\r\nto appearance\r\n\r\n896\r\n00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,400\r\nmenus and so now it we the services page\r\n\r\n897\r\n00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,559\r\nis still in this menu even though we\r\n\r\n898\r\n00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:50,800\r\ndeleted it so we can just delete this so\r\n\r\n899\r\n00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,599\r\njust do this drop- down menu here I can\r\n\r\n900\r\n00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,039\r\ngo to remove now I can add the new page\r\n\r\n901\r\n00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:01,358\r\nso we go to view all Monday memes and\r\n\r\n902\r\n00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:03,599\r\nthen add to menu and it'll just appear\r\n\r\n903\r\n00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,000\r\nat the bottom let's move it right below\r\n\r\n904\r\n00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,960\r\nthe home we don't want a sub item so we\r\n\r\n905\r\n00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,519\r\nhave to make sure it's goes correctly\r\n\r\n906\r\n00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:17,440\r\nthere and then we can save the menu okay\r\n\r\n907\r\n00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,280\r\nlet's see how this looks so far uh so\r\n\r\n908\r\n00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,400\r\nMonday\r\n\r\n909\r\n00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,159\r\nmemes so we still have the problem of\r\n\r\n910\r\n00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:26,480\r\nredesigning the rest and we can see that\r\n\r\n911\r\n00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,159\r\nwhen we go to Monday memes it's not\r\n\r\n912\r\n00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:30,358\r\nshowing the right logo there so that's\r\n\r\n913\r\n00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:34,559\r\nsimple enough to fix I'll just go to\r\n\r\n914\r\n00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,880\r\ncustomize and I'll click into this menu\r\n\r\n915\r\n00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,318\r\nand then I'm going to go where it says\r\n\r\n916\r\n00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:42,838\r\nsite title and Logo click there and now\r\n\r\n917\r\n00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:46,599\r\nwe can change the logo and we'll go back\r\n\r\n918\r\n00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:50,159\r\nwe'll go to the the light logo here or\r\n\r\n919\r\n00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:51,760\r\nactually this should probably be the\r\n\r\n920\r\n00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,440\r\ndark\r\n\r\n921\r\n00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,920\r\nlogo and let's just make sure we still\r\n\r\n922\r\n00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,679\r\nhave the light logo on the other the\r\n\r\n923\r\n00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:02,719\r\nother parts the other other pages and\r\n\r\n924\r\n00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:05,039\r\nwe'll make the logo just a little\r\n\r\n925\r\n00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:08,159\r\nsmaller okay good and now one thing I've\r\n\r\n926\r\n00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,960\r\nnoticed is it still says this love\r\n\r\n927\r\n00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,400\r\nnature everywhere so it says love nature\r\n\r\n928\r\n00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,960\r\nyou can see in the title says love\r\n\r\n929\r\n00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,039\r\nnature so we need to get that fixed I\r\n\r\n930\r\n00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:19,679\r\nthink I already fixed it but I must have\r\n\r\n931\r\n00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,639\r\nnot saved it we can go back to the\r\n\r\n932\r\n00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:25,480\r\nWordPress admin page go to\r\n\r\n933\r\n00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,719\r\nsettings and then we're going going to\r\n\r\n934\r\n00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:30,400\r\nchange this site title I think what\r\n\r\n935\r\n00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,159\r\nhappened is that after we installed the\r\n\r\n936\r\n00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:36,880\r\ntheme it updated the title which we had\r\n\r\n937\r\n00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,000\r\nalready changed so we'll do is it Monday\r\n\r\n938\r\n00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,679\r\ntoday and learn if it is Monday and\r\n\r\n939\r\n00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:50,039\r\neverything else should still be correct\r\n\r\n940\r\n00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:53,199\r\nso save changes and then if we go to the\r\n\r\n941\r\n00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:55,239\r\nsite we'll be able to see is it Monday\r\n\r\n942\r\n00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:58,599\r\ntoday it says is it Monday today oh and\r\n\r\n943\r\n00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:01,960\r\nthen it has our uh our slogan that we\r\n\r\n944\r\n00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,519\r\nput in learn if it is Monday okay we're\r\n\r\n945\r\n00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:08,358\r\ngetting close so you now know how to do\r\n\r\n946\r\n00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:11,760\r\na lot of changes but let's just finish\r\n\r\n947\r\n00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,679\r\nup the about page and the contact

of\r\n\r\n1127\r\n00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,318\r\nthis image so let's go back to phone\r\n\r\n1128\r\n00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:30,079\r\nmode and you can actually choose\r\n\r\n1129\r\n00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,480\r\ndifferent images depending on which mode\r\n\r\n1130\r\n00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,000\r\nyou're in so in in phone mode I'm going\r\n\r\n1131\r\n00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,480\r\nto choose one of these other images so\r\n\r\n1132\r\n00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:43,239\r\nnow when you're in desktop mode it's\r\n\r\n1133\r\n00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:45,480\r\ngoing to show this long image in the\r\n\r\n1134\r\n00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,599\r\nbackground but if you're on a phone it's\r\n\r\n1135\r\n00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,318\r\ngoing to show a smaller image in the\r\n\r\n1136\r\n00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:54,920\r\nbackground so when I'm on phone mode\r\n\r\n1137\r\n00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,880\r\nhere any changes I make to the site only\r\n\r\n1138\r\n00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,440\r\napply for users with a narrow width\r\n\r\n1139\r\n00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,440\r\nscreen like users on a mobile phone and\r\n\r\n1140\r\n00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,559\r\nthen if I'm on desktop mode any change I\r\n\r\n1141\r\n00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,199\r\nmake would only apply to the the desktop\r\n\r\n1142\r\n00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:13,159\r\nfor users with a wide screen so you can\r\n\r\n1143\r\n00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:17,358\r\nchange your styling depending on how\r\n\r\n1144\r\n00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:20,480\r\nwide the user screen is and another\r\n\r\n1145\r\n00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,480\r\nthing that changes depending on how wide\r\n\r\n1146\r\n00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,719\r\nthe user screen is is the menus so if I\r\n\r\n1147\r\n00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:28,599\r\nscroll bot to the bottom we can see the\r\n\r\n1148\r\n00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:32,239\r\nfooter but we cannot see the header menu\r\n\r\n1149\r\n00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:34,159\r\nin order to see that we have to go to\r\n\r\n1150\r\n00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:37,239\r\nthe other editing uh format so I'm just\r\n\r\n1151\r\n00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:39,960\r\ngoing to go to view page here I'll go to\r\n\r\n1152\r\n00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,280\r\ncustomize and when I'm on customize\r\n\r\n1153\r\n00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,318\r\nremember customize is what you have to\r\n\r\n1154\r\n00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:47,760\r\ngo to to see the to to make changes to\r\n\r\n1155\r\n00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,719\r\nthe header menu and we also have when\r\n\r\n1156\r\n00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,480\r\nwe're on customized we have similar\r\n\r\n1157\r\n00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,519\r\ncontrols between desktop mode tablet\r\n\r\n1158\r\n00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:59,280\r\nmode or or phone mode and then you can\r\n\r\n1159\r\n00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,838\r\nmake changes here so now that I'm on the\r\n\r\n1160\r\n00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:04,679\r\nphone mode I can make changes to what\r\n\r\n1161\r\n00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:07,480\r\nthis drop-down menu looks like this uh\r\n\r\n1162\r\n00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,719\r\nthis hamburger menu so I can change it\r\n\r\n1163\r\n00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:12,199\r\nto this style I can change it to this\r\n\r\n1164\r\n00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:15,400\r\nstyle and I think I'm just going to use\r\n\r\n1165\r\n00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,318\r\nthis three little dot style here and you\r\n\r\n1166\r\n00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:20,920\r\ncan even make different buttons show up\r\n\r\n1167\r\n00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,079\r\nlike for instance this now shows toggle\r\n\r\n1168\r\n00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:26,119\r\nbutton but when we're on the full menu\r\n\r\n1169\r\n00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:27,838\r\nor the full screen it's going to say\r\n\r\n1170\r\n00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:31,358\r\nprimary menu and it shows toggle button\r\n\r\n1171\r\n00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:34,960\r\nalso if we're on the tablet screen so\r\n\r\n1172\r\n00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,639\r\nbut we could change this and to show the\r\n\r\n1173\r\n00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:40,760\r\nfull menu even when on T Tablets by kind\r\n\r\n1174\r\n00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,480\r\nof like this so I'll publish that so now\r\n\r\n1175\r\n00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,798\r\nwe know how to make it responsive both\r\n\r\n1176\r\n00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:49,480\r\nfor the menus and for the other parts of\r\n\r\n1177\r\n00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,199\r\nour page okay we've basically covered\r\n\r\n1178\r\n00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:54,119\r\neverything and you should now know how\r\n\r\n1179\r\n00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:56,760\r\nto make your own website that should

this page looks like I'm\r\n\r\n1282\r\n01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:02,639\r\ngoing to go to\r\n\r\n1283\r\n01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:05,719\r\ncustomize and we go to blog and we can\r\n\r\n1284\r\n01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:07,400\r\nchange what a single post looks like we\r\n\r\n1285\r\n01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,920\r\ncan uh change what the list of posts\r\n\r\n1286\r\n01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,920\r\nlooks like so I'm going to make it so\r\n\r\n1287\r\n01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,400\r\nit's narrower and we're going to do a\r\n\r\n1288\r\n01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,039\r\nlist View and then we can change just\r\n\r\n1289\r\n01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:20,159\r\nall all these things about what we're to\r\n\r\n1290\r\n01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:22,000\r\nsee like we may not want to see the the\r\n\r\n1291\r\n01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,798\r\nfeatured image or we may want to see it\r\n\r\n1292\r\n01:00:24,798 --> 01:00:26,920\r\nuh I'm going to turn off the post meta\r\n\r\n1293\r\n01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,960\r\nso it's not going to show like leave a\r\n\r\n1294\r\n01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,280\r\ncomment and all that stuff like that\r\n\r\n1295\r\n01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,440\r\nokay this looks good so I'll just\r\n\r\n1296\r\n01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,159\r\npublish\r\n\r\n1297\r\n01:00:35,159 --> 01:00:37,519\r\nthis okay let's just finalize some\r\n\r\n1298\r\n01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:39,239\r\nthings like we'll delete that blog po\r\n\r\n1299\r\n01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:41,079\r\nthat final blog\r\n\r\n1300\r\n01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:45,880\r\npost so we go to post all posts and then\r\n\r\n1301\r\n01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,119\r\nwe can just uh click the trash button\r\n\r\n1302\r\n01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,559\r\nfor this one and then we want to make\r\n\r\n1303\r\n01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,519\r\nthe footer fix like sometimes once you\r\n\r\n1304\r\n01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:57,798\r\nadd things other parts of your site\r\n\r\n1305\r\n01:00:57,798 --> 01:01:01,159\r\nstart looking not as good like for\r\n\r\n1306\r\n01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:04,039\r\ninstance the footer now the contact goes\r\n\r\n1307\r\n01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:06,280\r\nto the next line here so we need to\r\n\r\n1308\r\n01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,199\r\nupdate this first let's see what happens\r\n\r\n1309\r\n01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:12,039\r\nat different widths so you can see once\r\n\r\n1310\r\n01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:15,880\r\nwe go to the tablet width it's going to\r\n\r\n1311\r\n01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,639\r\nbe on its own line and that looks fine\r\n\r\n1312\r\n01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:21,679\r\nso we want to make sure this looks\r\n\r\n1313\r\n01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:24,199\r\nbetter I think the simplest way to do\r\n\r\n1314\r\n01:01:24,199 --> 01:01:26,199\r\nthat is just going to be take take out\r\n\r\n1315\r\n01:01:26,199 --> 01:01:28,239\r\nthe word Monday so it's just home

01:01:47,119\r\nmemes I'm going to change what the\r\n\r\n1321\r\n01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:50,760\r\nnavigation label is just to memes so the\r\n\r\n1322\r\n01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,880\r\npage is still called Monday memes but\r\n\r\n1323\r\n01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,278\r\nthe navigation is just called memes same\r\n\r\n1324\r\n01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:56,440\r\nwith blog\r\n\r\n1325\r\n01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,920\r\nso I'll change that and then you save\r\n\r\n1326\r\n01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,199\r\nthe menu when you just make sure we have\r\n\r\n1327\r\n01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:02,679\r\nto wait till it finishes\r\n\r\n1328\r\n01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:06,199\r\nsaving and we'll visit the\r\n\r\n1329\r\n01:02:06,199 -->

on your own now let's get\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,200\r\nstarted okay so let me open up visual\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,359\r\nstudio and create our\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:55,078\r\nproject just click on create a new\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:58,560\r\nproject and we're going to select an MVC\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:58,560

you\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,080\r\nshould take care of when creating a full\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,878\r\nstock project is specifying the type of\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,000\r\ndata that your application will take for\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,479\r\nthis reason we need to go to the models\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,318\r\nfolder and create our model classes\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:53,959\r\nwhich basically just represent the data\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,400\r\nof our application each model class will\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,639\r\nrepresent a table in our database and\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,840\r\nhere we will give properties to these\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,080\r\nmodels which will actually then\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,439\r\nrepresent each column of a table in the\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:09,199\r\ndatabase so we'll see how this all works\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,719\r\njust go to models click on add a new\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,799\r\nclass and for our project I will name\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:16,759\r\nthe\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:21,598\r\nclass expense. CS since we'll store our\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,719\r\nexpenses in the database and here in the\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,318\r\nclass we will need to specify properties\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:30,959\r\nthat we want this model or this class to\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,639\r\nhave first of all we need an INT

it date and each time a user\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,560\r\ncreates an expense I'll set it to be\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,240\r\nthat we will take the actual date when a\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,160\r\nuser stores this expense so I will use\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,199\r\nthe method here date time do now which\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:05:12,199

--> 00:06:04,519\r\nthat we can add some validation rules\r\n\r\n134\r\n00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:07,399\r\nusing data annotations data annotations\r\n\r\n135\r\n00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:10,079\r\nare these attributes we set to each\r\n\r\n136\r\n00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,000\r\nproperty so that we restrict the type of\r\n\r\n137\r\n00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,120\r\ndata that users input so actually the in\r\n\r\n138\r\n00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,120\r\nID property is created by default and\r\n\r\n139\r\n00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,680\r\nit's required by default let's say we\r\n\r\n140\r\n00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,120\r\nwant the description to be\r\n\r\n141\r\n00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,478\r\nrequired so that whenever a user\r\n\r\n142\r\n00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:30,720\r\nregisters an exp expense they need to\r\n\r\n143\r\n00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,360\r\nspecify the description for that expense\r\n\r\n144\r\n00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,160\r\nwe can write a data annotation called\r\n\r\n145\r\n00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,038\r\nrequired here and actually this library\r\n\r\n146\r\n00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,560\r\nof data annotations was imported on top\r\n\r\n147\r\n00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,959\r\nof the page and we can add the same data\r\n\r\n148\r\n00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,038\r\nannotation for both the\r\n\r\n149\r\n00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:53,199\r\namount and the category properties so\r\n\r\n150\r\n00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,918\r\nthat these are all required Properties\r\n\r\n151\r\n00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:58,038\r\nby the users as I said the ID is\r\n\r\n152\r\n00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:02,279\r\ngenerated automat Ally and the date\r\n\r\n153\r\n00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:05,879\r\nproperty is set by this method\r\n\r\n154\r\n00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,079\r\nautomatically as well as soon as an\r\n\r\n155\r\n00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,319\r\nexpense is created and we can set all\r\n\r\n156\r\n00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,319\r\nkinds of restrictions to our properties\r\n\r\n157\r\n00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,720\r\nto the data that users input we can\r\n\r\n158\r\n00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,639\r\nlet's let me take another example we\r\n\r\n159\r\n00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,199\r\ncan set here for the amount property AR\r\n\r\n160\r\n00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,439\r\nrange for so that we do not accept like\r\n\r\n161\r\n00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:29,519\r\nnegative numbers so I'll put the min\r\n\r\n162\r\n00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,160\r\nminimum value here to be\r\n\r\n163\r\n00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,120\r\n0.01 then the maximum value to be the\r\n\r\n164\r\n00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,839\r\nmaximum value that the double can take\r\n\r\n165\r\n00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,519\r\nthat's just the expression you can use\r\n\r\n166\r\n00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,000\r\nfor this reason and we also actually we\r\n\r\n167\r\n00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,439\r\nhave this data annotation has I think\r\n\r\n168\r\n00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,680\r\nthe property to be able to specify the\r\n\r\n169\r\n00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,319\r\nerror\r\n\r\n170\r\n00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,038\r\nmessage so the error message will be\r\n\r\n171\r\n00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:56,360\r\nshown to the users whenever they input\r\n\r\n172\r\n00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,519\r\nlike a negative amount there so amount\r\n\r\n173\r\n00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,199\r\nneeds to be higher than\r\n\r\n174\r\n00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,959\r\nzero okay now we have arrived to the fun\r\n\r\n175\r\n00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,598\r\npart just kidding at least not yet but\r\n\r\n176\r\n00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:11,519\r\nwe firstly need we need to connect our\r\n\r\n177\r\n00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,800\r\nproject to the database how we will do\r\n\r\n178\r\n00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,519\r\nthis is that the most common way you're\r\n\r\n179\r\n00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,759\r\nactually going to use to interact with a\r\n\r\n180\r\n00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:21,680\r\ndatabase is using Entity framework core\r\n\r\n181\r\n00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,439\r\nthe exact definition of it is that it is\r\n\r\n182\r\n00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:27,360\r\nan object relational mapper or in uh\r\n\r\n183\r\n00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,959\r\nsimilar words just remember Entity\r\n\r\n184\r\n00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,839\r\nframework core as a framework that\r\n\r\n185\r\n00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:34,320\r\nallows us to interact with a database\r\n\r\n186\r\n00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,000\r\nusing net objects instead of raw SQL\r\n\r\n187\r\n00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,559\r\nqueries we are going to see how this\r\n\r\n188\r\n00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,958\r\nworks but the first step to connecting\r\n\r\n189\r\n00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,200\r\nour project with a database will be one\r\n\r\n190\r\n00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200\r\nof the main parts of entity frame\r\n\r\n191\r\n00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,720\r\nframework core is creating the context\r\n\r\n192\r\n00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,958\r\nclass and we need to go to the root of\r\n\r\n193\r\n00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,000\r\nour project here and add a folder named\r\n\r\n194\r\n00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,200\r\ndata just as a practice that is the\r\n\r\n195\r\n00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,879\r\nplace place where we will store our\r\n\r\n196\r\n00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:04,839\r\ncontext here inside our data folder I'm\r\n\r\n197\r\n00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,759\r\ngoing to add a class and I'm name it\r\n\r\n198\r\n00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,519\r\nlike finance app context give it just a\r\n\r\n199\r\n00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,360\r\nname and as I was saying this context\r\n\r\n200\r\n00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,200\r\nclass is basically the bridge between\r\n\r\n201\r\n00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,639\r\nour project and the database and this\r\n\r\n202\r\n00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,679\r\nhas all kinds of methods and properties\r\n\r\n203\r\n00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,759\r\nthat allow us to query data from the\r\n\r\n204\r\n00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,839\r\ndatabase store data in there in the\r\n\r\n205\r\n00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,240\r\ncontext class we specify an instance

way\r\n\r\n208\r\n00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,720\r\nthis is the instance we will create here\r\n\r\n209\r\n00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,879\r\nwill be the way that we will will\r\n\r\n210\r\n00:09:43,879

well for each model class we create\r\n\r\n277\r\n00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,519\r\nin our project we need to set an\r\n\r\n278\r\n00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,679\r\ninstance\r\n\r\n279\r\n00:12:59,679

00:20:33,000\r\ndatabase for our project let's just\r\n\r\n438\r\n00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,480\r\nshift our Focus to the controller and\r\n\r\n439\r\n00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,279\r\nthe view let me just go back to our\r\n\r\n440\r\n00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,759\r\nproject here and as you can see we\r\n\r\n441\r\n00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:43,279\r\nalready have a controllers folder\r\n\r\n442\r\n00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,038\r\ntogether with a controller class here\r\n\r\n443\r\n00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:48,319\r\nlike a default controller class with a\r\n\r\n444\r\n00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,319\r\ncouple of methods there and what the\r\n\r\n445\r\n00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,960\r\ncontroller does is basically it handles\r\n\r\n446\r\n00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,960\r\nthe backend logic of our application it\r\n\r\n447\r\n00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,319\r\ntakes requests from the users quer is\r\n\r\n448\r\n00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:02,240\r\nthe necessary data from our database and\r\n\r\n449\r\n00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,000\r\nthen gives the appropriate response\r\n\r\n450\r\n00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,558\r\ntogether with its corresponding view\r\n\r\n451\r\n00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,679\r\nback to the users so let's just create a\r\n\r\n452\r\n00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:13,240\r\ncontroller first and see how everything\r\n\r\n453\r\n00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,720\r\nworks there let me just add here a\r\n\r\n454\r\n00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,880\r\ncontroller inside our controllers folder\r\n\r\n455\r\n00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,359\r\nlet me have an empty MVC\r\n\r\n456\r\n00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:29,079\r\ncontroller and I'm going to name it with\r\n\r\n457\r\n00:21:29,079 -->

description\r\n\r\n608\r\n00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,119\r\nand then the items\r\n\r\n609\r\n00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:39,200\r\namount let's WR the dollar sign\r\n\r\n610\r\n00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,558\r\nhere the items\r\n\r\n611\r\n00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:49,679\r\ncategory and the let's say the items\r\n\r\n612\r\n00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,278\r\nwhich was the last property the the\r\n\r\n613\r\n00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:55,038\r\nitems dat and we can just format the\r\n\r\n614\r\n00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:58,079\r\ndate using the two string method so that\r\n\r\n615\r\n00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:03,159\r\nthe time only contains the year the\r\n\r\n616\r\n00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:07,919\r\nmonth and the date and let me just give\r\n\r\n617\r\n00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,159\r\nsome stylings to the tables so well I'm\r\n\r\n618\r\n00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:12,880\r\njust going to use a few bootstrap\r\n\r\n619\r\n00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,398\r\nclasses to make the table a bit better\r\n\r\n620\r\n00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,440\r\nlooking visually so I'm giving it a\r\n\r\n621\r\n00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,319\r\ntable class and the table bordered class\r\n\r\n622\r\n00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,119\r\nas well so that the table has some\r\n\r\n623\r\n00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:28,398\r\nborders and the table header I'm going\r\n\r\n624\r\n00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,200\r\nto give to it like\r\n\r\n625\r\n00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,679\r\num\r\n\r\n626\r\n00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:40,759\r\ntable light\r\n\r\n627\r\n00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:43,599\r\nclass and let me just run the project\r\n\r\n628\r\n00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:45,960\r\nand see how our view page looks like at\r\n\r\n629\r\n00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:52,398\r\nthe\r\n\r\n630\r\n00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:55,440\r\nmoment okay so this is the root of our\r\n\r\n631\r\n00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,079\r\nweb application this redirects us\r\n\r\n632\r\n00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:01,839\r\nactually by default to our\r\n\r\n633\r\n00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:04,558\r\ncontroller to our home controller to

the name of our\r\n\r\n639\r\n00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,359\r\nexpenses controller SL index we should\r\n\r\n640\r\n00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:25,558\r\nbe redirected to the view page that

table header with this properties\r\n\r\n644\r\n00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,599\r\nthat we specified here the my expenses\r\n\r\n645\r\n00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:40,159\r\nheader as well as you can see this is\r\n\r\n646\r\n00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,679\r\nour routing in asp.net core works so if\r\n\r\n647\r\n00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,200\r\nwe're write the name of the

now\r\n\r\n650\r\n00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:52,519\r\nto actually have some data in our table\r\n\r\n651\r\n00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:54,919\r\nwe're going to need to create a

go\r\n\r\n654\r\n00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,038\r\nback to our\r\n\r\n655\r\n00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,798\r\ncontroller and create another action\r\n\r\n656\r\n00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,839\r\nmethod for a create page so\r\n\r\n657\r\n00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:13,599\r\npublic I action\r\n\r\n658\r\n00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,519\r\nresult which is the return type of our\r\n\r\n659\r\n00:32:16,519 -->

redirect the users to the page\r\n\r\n665\r\n00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,440\r\nwith the form where they can submit the\r\n\r\n666\r\n00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,599\r\ndata for which we're actually going

00:35:36,480\r\nfor description as well so this asp4\r\n\r\n713\r\n00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,599\r\ntags are just eraser syntax tags that\r\n\r\n714\r\n00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,719\r\nbind these specific elements to the\r\n\r\n715\r\n00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:45,599\r\nspecific property and make sure that the\r\n\r\n716\r\n00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,719\r\nnaming for example for this label or the\r\n\r\n717\r\n00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:51,039\r\nvalidation will be correct I'm just\r\n\r\n718\r\n00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:53,800\r\ngoing to also specify a class here for\r\n\r\n719\r\n00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,280\r\nthe label which is form label this is\r\n\r\n720\r\n00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,159\r\njust a bootstrap class again and also a\r\n\r\n721\r\n00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,800\r\nclass for the input like form control\r\n\r\n722\r\n00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,480\r\nwhich is like a bootstrap class for\r\n\r\n723\r\n00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,119\r\ninput so they look visually better and\r\n\r\n724\r\n00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,920\r\nI'm going to copy\r\n\r\n725\r\n00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:22,079\r\nthis and do the same thing for the\r\n\r\n726\r\n00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:30,159\r\namount for the category\r\n\r\n727\r\n00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:35,000\r\nand at the very end we're going to\r\n\r\n728\r\n00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,838\r\nneed a\r\n\r\n729\r\n00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:41,760\r\nbutton of type\r\n\r\n730\r\n00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,000\r\nsubmit to submit the data that the form\r\n\r\n731\r\n00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,679\r\nwill take I'll just add a few classes of\r\n\r\n732\r\n00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:51,239\r\nbutton and button\r\n\r\n733\r\n00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:54,039\r\nprimary to make the button visually\r\n\r\n734\r\n00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:56,719\r\nbetter and let's write inside here add\r\n\r\n735\r\n00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,280\r\nexpense or something like that let me\r\n\r\n736\r\n00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,318\r\njust run the app one our time to just\r\n\r\n737\r\n00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:07,119\r\nsee how this page will look\r\n\r\n738\r\n00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,480\r\nlike so if we go to expenses slash\r\n\r\n739\r\n00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,800\r\ncreate we should be redirected to the\r\n\r\n740\r\n00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,920\r\nview page that we just\r\n\r\n741\r\n00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,000\r\ncreated okay so add expense we here we\r\n\r\n742\r\n00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,358\r\nneed to write the description the

00:37:32,358\r\nhere just a simple form what's left for\r\n\r\n746\r\n00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:35,960\r\nus to do next is to actually create the\r\n\r\n747\r\n00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,199\r\ncreate post action method so that the\r\n\r\n748\r\n00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:41,920\r\nform submission when user submits a form\r\n\r\n749\r\n00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,400\r\nthat data will be stored in our

00:38:06,079\r\nmethod and this will actually take an\r\n\r\n756\r\n00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,400\r\nexpense model let's\r\n\r\n757\r\n00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,679\r\ngive a name to this variable of expense\r\n\r\n758\r\n00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,119\r\nlet's just import the model so this\r\n\r\n759\r\n00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,519\r\nexpense model is recognized and here we\r\n\r\n760\r\n00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:23,159\r\nactually firstly going to check if our\r\n\r\n761\r\n00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:25,838\r\nthe model that this method will take is\r\n\r\n762\r\n00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:29,559\r\ncorrect for this reason we need to use\r\n\r\n763\r\n00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:32,880\r\nthis property if\r\n\r\n764\r\n00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,119\r\nmodel\r\n\r\n765\r\n00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,079\r\nstate that is\r\n\r\n766\r\n00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,559\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n767\r\n00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:43,599\r\nvalid we will then use the context here\r\n\r\n768\r\n00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,119\r\nby writing underline context that expans\r\n\r\n769\r\n00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,920\r\nthe name of the dbet instance. add the\r\n\r\n770\r\n00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,318\r\nexpense we're receiving from the form\r\n\r\n771\r\n00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:56,880\r\nand then we'll need to save the changes\r\n\r\n772\r\n00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,880\r\nto the data database by again using the\r\n\r\n773\r\n00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,519\r\ncontext and then the save\r\n\r\n774\r\n00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:07,639\r\nchanges method and then at the end we\r\n\r\n775\r\n00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:10,519\r\nwill need to redirect the\r\n\r\n776\r\n00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:14,400\r\nusers with the redirect to

the data is not valid we will\r\n\r\n782\r\n00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,800\r\nthen redirect the users this will be\r\n\r\n783\r\n00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,760\r\nfalse so the users will be redirected to\r\n\r\n784\r\n00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,239\r\nthe same create page together with the\r\n\r\n785\r\n00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,599\r\nexpense model that they inputed there\r\n\r\n786\r\n00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,960\r\nand if I just we just run the\r\n\r\n787\r\n00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,800\r\napplication one more time and check the\r\n\r\n788\r\n00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,639\r\nfunctionality of

say\r\n\r\n791\r\n00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,480\r\nrent the amount was like $300 or\r\n\r\n792\r\n00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,760\r\nsomething and the category will be like\r\n\r\n793\r\n00:40:02,760

need to write the asyn\r\n\r\n828\r\n00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:47,480\r\nkeyword here and asynchronous methods\r\n\r\n829\r\n00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,838\r\nreturn a task and in this case a task of\r\n\r\n830\r\n00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:54,639\r\nI action result and we need to write the\r\n\r\n831\r\n00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,239\r\nawait keyword before we make make this\r\n\r\n832\r\n00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:01,719\r\ncall to the database also the correct\r\n\r\n833\r\n00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:04,239\r\nmethod that should be used in this case\r\n\r\n834\r\n00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:09,639\r\nis to list a sync method and we need to\r\n\r\n835\r\n00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:12,639\r\nimport Entity framework or on top of the\r\n\r\n836\r\n00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:17,358\r\npage so now when we are calling this we\r\n\r\n837\r\n00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:20,280\r\nare waiting for this data to arrive from\r\n\r\n838\r\n00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,358\r\nthe database the main third of our\r\n\r\n839\r\n00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:24,838\r\napplication is opened and this doesn't\r\n\r\n840\r\n00:42:24,838

create action method since here as\r\n\r\n843\r\n00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:34,280\r\nwell we're performing an operation to\r\n\r\n844\r\n00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,599\r\nthe database so just write the async\r\n\r\n845\r\n00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,760\r\nkeyword here we'll return a\r\n\r\n846\r\n00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,400\r\ntask of I action\r\n\r\n847\r\n00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,760\r\nresult and we need to write the await\r\n\r\n848\r\n00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,000\r\nkeyword when we're saving the changes to\r\n\r\n849\r\n00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,599\r\nthe database and actually the\r\n\r\n850\r\n00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,480\r\nsynchronous method in this case is\r\n\r\n851\r\n00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,119\r\ncalled save changes\r\n\r\n852\r\n00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:00,679\r\nasync okay now that we have turned these\r\n\r\n853\r\n00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:03,719\r\ntwo action methods to asynchronous the\r\n\r\n854\r\n00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:06,639\r\nnext thing is that especially when we\r\n\r\n855\r\n00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:08,599\r\nare deploying our application or\r\n\r\n856\r\n00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:11,519\r\npublishing it live on the web it's not a\r\n\r\n857\r\n00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:13,639\r\ngood practice to access the datab based\r\n\r\n858\r\n00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:16,079\r\ninside the controller for this reason we\r\n\r\n859\r\n00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,000\r\nneed to use services so that we access\r\n\r\n860\r\n00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,719\r\nthe context in another place in a more\r\n\r\n861\r\n00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:24,960\r\nsecure place in our application so to\r\n\r\n862\r\n00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,039\r\nsay and then here we will actually call\r\n\r\n863\r\n00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:30,800\r\nour service and perform the operations\r\n\r\n864\r\n00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,119\r\nthat we're performing here using this\r\n\r\n865\r\n00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,800\r\nservice you'll see how this works the\r\n\r\n866\r\n00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,440\r\nservices are stored usually inside our\r\n\r\n867\r\n00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,000\r\ndata\r\n\r\n868\r\n00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,480\r\nfolder we can create a Services folder\r\n\r\n869\r\n00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,480\r\nas a good practice because we may\r\n\r\n870\r\n00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,400\r\nactually create many services inside a\r\n\r\n871\r\n00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,800\r\nsingle application and here we are going\r\n\r\n872\r\n00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,039\r\nto need firstly an interface and a class\r\n\r\n873\r\n00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:57,159\r\nin the interface we need to write the\r\n\r\n874\r\n00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:59,760\r\nmethod signatures of our methods and\r\n\r\n875\r\n00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,480\r\nthen in the service class we will need\r\n\r\n876\r\n00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,639\r\nto implement these interfaces the\r\n\r\n877\r\n00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:07,079\r\npurpose of the methods that we will\r\n\r\n878\r\n00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:09,400\r\ncreate there will be just the same as\r\n\r\n879\r\n00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,480\r\nhere we will create a method to access\r\n\r\n880\r\n00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,400\r\nto get all the data from the database\r\n\r\n881\r\n00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,679\r\nand a second one to add and to store the\r\n\r\n882\r\n00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:19,880\r\ndata to our database so whatever we're\r\n\r\n883\r\n00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,679\r\ndoing in our sidea controller that has\r\n\r\n884\r\n00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:24,838\r\nto do with accessing the database we\r\n\r\n885\r\n00:44:24,838 --> 00:44:27,400\r\nwill do there and then we will call that\r\n\r\n886\r\n00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,159\r\nservice let's just see how this works in\r\n\r\n887\r\n00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:32,559\r\naction so first thing I'm going to add\r\n\r\n888\r\n00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,079\r\nnew item an interface I'm going to name\r\n\r\n889\r\n00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,559\r\nit as a good practice\r\n\r\n890\r\n00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:44,960\r\nI expenses\r\n\r\n891\r\n00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,519\r\nservice here we will write the method\r\n\r\n892\r\n00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:52,199\r\nsignatures this is how interfaces work\r\n\r\n893\r\n00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:55,519\r\nso the first method will return a\r\n\r\n894\r\n00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:59,920\r\ntask of I a\r\n\r\n895\r\n00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,400\r\nnumerable of\r\n\r\n896\r\n00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,559\r\nexpenses of type expense and I will name\r\n\r\n897\r\n00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:10,159\r\nit get\r\n\r\n898\r\n00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:13,519\r\nall and this method won't take any\r\n\r\n899\r\n00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:16,159\r\nparameters let I think we need to import\r\n\r\n900\r\n00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,800\r\nthe models folder on top of our page\r\n\r\n901\r\n00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,280\r\nokay and the second method will be a\r\n\r\n902\r\n00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,880\r\nmethod will return a task since this\r\n\r\n903\r\n00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,358\r\nwill be an asynchronous method that's\r\n\r\n904\r\n00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:29,800\r\nwhy we need the task keyword here as the\r\n\r\n905\r\n00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,079\r\nreturn type and\r\n\r\n906\r\n00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,039\r\nthen let's name it like\r\n\r\n907\r\n00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:38,079\r\nadd and this will take as parameter an\r\n\r\n908\r\n00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,358\r\nexpense model and we can give this\r\n\r\n909\r\n00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:42,639\r\nvariable the name\r\n\r\n910\r\n00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:45,679\r\nexpense these are two method\r\n\r\n911\r\n00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:49,079\r\nsignatures now let's just create a class\r\n\r\n912\r\n00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,119\r\nwhere we need to implement these methods\r\n\r\n913\r\n00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,199\r\nand where we will need to access the\r\n\r\n914\r\n00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:57,039\r\ncontext\r\n\r\n915\r\n00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:00,679\r\nso just add a class I will name this\r\n\r\n916\r\n00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:05,838\r\nexpenses\r\n\r\n917\r\n00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:09,119\r\nservice and here we need\r\n\r\n918\r\n00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,039\r\nto implement this interface that we\r\n\r\n919\r\n00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:15,838\r\ncreated if you click on the error here\r\n\r\n920\r\n00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:18,318\r\nyou have an option to implement\r\n\r\n921\r\n00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:20,880\r\ninterface and here we have our two\r\n\r\n922\r\n00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,639\r\nmethods that we need to modify a little\r\n\r\n923\r\n00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:25,719\r\nbit but what we're going to need to do\r\n\r\n924\r\n00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:27,679\r\nhere in the beginning is is that we will\r\n\r\n925\r\n00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:30,599\r\nneed to access the context so we need a\r\n\r\n926\r\n00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:33,079\r\nConstructor and actually what we'll do\r\n\r\n927\r\n00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:35,719\r\nis just take the code we need the\r\n\r\n928\r\n00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:37,960\r\nvariable for the context just like this\r\n\r\n929\r\n00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:44,599\r\none that we had inside of our\r\n\r\n930\r\n00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:48,119\r\ncontroller and\r\n\r\n931\r\n00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:51,318\r\nhere we need to write the name\r\n\r\n932\r\n00:46:51,318 --> 00:46:53,559\r\nof the\r\n\r\n933\r\n00:46:53,559 --> 00:47:00,559\r\ncontext variable for it\r\n\r\n934\r\n00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:02,800\r\nand we'll assign to this variable the\r\n\r\n935\r\n00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,559\r\nvalue of the context that we are taking\r\n\r\n936\r\n00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:08,159\r\nhere in our\r\n\r\n937\r\n00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,960\r\nConstructor now here in both of these\r\n\r\n938\r\n00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,280\r\ntwo methods we need to perform the\r\n\r\n939\r\n00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,400\r\noperations that we were performing in\r\n\r\n940\r\n00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,519\r\nour controllers so for the get old\r\n\r\n941\r\n00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:22,960\r\nmethod we just need to access to get the\r\n\r\n942\r\n00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,440\r\ndata from the database like we did in\r\n\r\n943\r\n00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,079\r\nthis case so let's copy\r\n\r\n944\r\n00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:32,519\r\nthat and in the get all method\r\n\r\n945\r\n00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:38,480\r\njust paste this here and then\r\n\r\n946\r\n00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,159\r\nreturn the\r\n\r\n947\r\n00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:43,760\r\nexpenses and the method needs to be\r\n\r\n948\r\n00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,318\r\nasynchronous with the async keyword\r\n\r\n949\r\n00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:51,358\r\nhere and about the first method let me\r\n\r\n950\r\n00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:54,318\r\ngo again to the controller and we need\r\n\r\n951\r\n00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:57,960\r\nto perform this operation there\r\n\r\n952\r\n00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,400\r\nso once again to the\r\n\r\n953\r\n00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,480\r\nservice this is also an asynchronous\r\n\r\n954\r\n00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,480\r\nmethod so we need to write the

use\r\n\r\n1016\r\n00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,760\r\nthe scope service so that we maintain\r\n\r\n1017\r\n00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,119\r\nthe state of our application so in one\r\n\r\n1018\r\n00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:45,280\r\nHTP request a single instance of that\r\n\r\n1019\r\n00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,798\r\nservice is created and after we write\r\n\r\n1020\r\n00:51:47,798 --> 00:51:50,119\r\nhere add and then the lifetime of the\r\n\r\n1021\r\n00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:54,039\r\nservice here we need to specify\r\n\r\n1022\r\n00:51:54,039

have\r\n\r\n1093\r\n00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,920\r\nread this before so I'm just going to\r\n\r\n1094\r\n00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,358\r\nclick on get started we will not read\r\n\r\n1095\r\n00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:10,440\r\neverything through in this video but\r\n\r\n1096\r\n00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,000\r\njust go here to getting started and as I\r\n\r\n1097\r\n00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,239\r\nwas saying you're going to need to learn\r\n\r\n1098\r\n00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:18,400\r\nand understand documentation from

here\r\n\r\n1101\r\n00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,239\r\nwe need a canvas ID element on our\r\n\r\n1102\r\n00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:30,719\r\nscreen which we'll need\r\n\r\n1103\r\n00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:33,559\r\nto we will need to paste in our index\r\n\r\n1104\r\n00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:36,318\r\nview page so after we show the table\r\n\r\n1105\r\n00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:38,039\r\nhere I'm actually going to write a\r\n\r\n1106\r\n00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:39,838\r\nheader for\r\n\r\n1107\r\n00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:45,000\r\nlike writing like expenses overview or\r\n\r\n1108\r\n00:55:45,000

this\r\n\r\n1111\r\n00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:58,639\r\nscript Tex tag importing this chartjs\r\n\r\n1112\r\n00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:02,440\r\nlibrary and inside another script tag\r\n\r\n1113\r\n00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,599\r\nthis is the way how we can actually\r\n\r\n1114\r\n00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:07,639\r\ncreate a chart object in our screen we\r\n\r\n1115\r\n00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:11,039\r\nspecify here in this type attribute what\r\n\r\n1116\r\n00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:14,199\r\nkind of chart we want we take so we take\r\n\r\n1117\r\n00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:17,838\r\nfirstly the element which was our canvas\r\n\r\n1118\r\n00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:20,639\r\nelement then we ar specify the type

static if we copy this\r\n\r\n1124\r\n00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,960\r\ncode we will have this labels sprinted\r\n\r\n1125\r\n00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,400\r\nout and then the data we'll see this as\r\n\r\n1126\r\n00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,039\r\nthis numbers as the data on our screen\r\n\r\n1127\r\n00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:44,400\r\nbut ideally what we would want to do for\r\n\r\n1128\r\n00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,719\r\nour specific project we want to get each\r\n\r\n1129\r\n00:56:47,719 --> 00:56:50,838\r\ncategory and the sum of the amount

to\r\n\r\n1136\r\n00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:11,239\r\ndo it would be to filter the data that\r\n\r\n1137\r\n00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:14,599\r\nwe want through a link query in our\r\n\r\n1138\r\n00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:18,280\r\ncontroller return this as a Json data\r\n\r\n1139\r\n00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,079\r\nand then we need to make a request

saying\r\n\r\n1144\r\n00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:35,639\r\nbefore we cannot do everything only with\r\n\r\n1145\r\n00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:37,760\r\nC code so for this specific\r\n\r\n1146\r\n00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,159\r\nfunctionality I would suggest this is\r\n\r\n1147\r\n00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:43,880\r\nthe best way to proceed so actually I'm\r\n\r\n1148\r\n00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:53,079\r\njust copying this at first this tags\r\n\r\n1149\r\n00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:55,760\r\nhere paston down below let me run the\r\n\r\n1150\r\n00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,639\r\napp on more time to see how it looks\r\n\r\n1151\r\n00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:06,358\r\nlike just as it\r\n\r\n1152\r\n00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:09,719\r\nis okay we see this chart being printed\r\n\r\n1153\r\n00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:13,519\r\nout with the data that we had here\r\n\r\n1154\r\n00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:16,199\r\nbasically we see a bar chart all of this\r\n\r\n1155\r\n00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:18,798\r\ndata represented here with it but we\r\n\r\n1156\r\n00:58:18,798 --> 00:58:21,480\r\nwant to adjust this to meet our\r\n\r\n1157\r\n00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,599\r\napplications needs as I was saying\r\n\r\n1158\r\n00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,159\r\nbefore so the first thing I'm actually\r\n\r\n1159\r\n00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:29,639\r\ngoing to do is go to our controller to\r\n\r\n1160\r\n00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:33,358\r\nexpenses controller and let's create\r\n\r\n1161\r\n00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:36,280\r\nanother action\r\n\r\n1162\r\n00:58:36,280 -->

00:59:00,400\r\nfirstly we will need to query the data\r\n\r\n1168\r\n00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,400\r\nthe categories and the total amount of\r\n\r\n1169\r\n00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,400\r\nexpenses for each category in our\r\n\r\n1170\r\n00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,280\r\nexpenses service so that we query the\r\n\r\n1171\r\n00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,239\r\ndata from the database using our service\r\n\r\n1172\r\n00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:14,440\r\nand if I just go to the interface\r\n\r\n1173\r\n00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,960\r\nfirstly here let's write the method\r\n\r\n1174\r\n00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,798\r\nsignature the method that we will create\r\n\r\n1175\r\n00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:22,760\r\nwill return a type of I\r\n\r\n1176\r\n00:59:22,760 -->

used to query collections\r\n\r\n1179\r\n00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:32,960\r\nbut it is ideal when we're using link\r\n\r\n1180\r\n00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,480\r\nqueries because all of this quering will\r\n\r\n1181\r\n00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,880\r\nhappen in the database this is a\r\n\r\n1182\r\n00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,000\r\nperformance reason why I'm choosing I\r\n\r\n1183\r\n00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,798\r\nquable yes you will see we'll make this\r\n\r\n1184\r\n00:59:43,798 --> 00:59:46,400\r\nlink queries to filter the data that we\r\n\r\n1185\r\n00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,000\r\nwant and we will receive in application\r\n\r\n1186\r\n00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,920\r\nonly the data that we need I'm just\r\n\r\n1187\r\n00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,679\r\ngoing to name this method like

01:00:06,679\r\nservice we should see an error\r\n\r\n1191\r\n01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:09,239\r\nhere allowing us\r\n\r\n1192\r\n01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:11,280\r\nto\r\n\r\n1193\r\n01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,838\r\nimplement that method signature okay\r\n\r\n1194\r\n01:00:14,838 --> 01:00:19,119\r\nthis will this is our method so let's\r\n\r\n1195\r\n01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:22,920\r\njust take a variable I'll name data and\r\n\r\n1196\r\n01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:28,798\r\nhere we will access our context\r\n\r\n1197\r\n01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:34,358\r\nexpenses we want to group our

name a variable\r\n\r\n1201\r\n01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:51,798\r\ne e.\r\n\r\n1202\r\n01:00:51,798 --> 01:00:55,119\r\ncategory and then here we will select\r\n\r\n1203\r\n01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:59,159\r\nwrite this select\r\n\r\n1204\r\n01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:02,599\r\nmethod take a variable there and with\r\n\r\n1205\r\n01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:04,559\r\nthis new keyword we are basically\r\n\r\n1206\r\n01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,400\r\ncreating an anonymous object we will\r\n\r\n1207\r\n01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,280\r\ncreate an object with a couple\r\n\r\n1208\r\n01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,760\r\nproperties so they store each category\r\n\r\n1209\r\n01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,318\r\nand the total amount spent for each\r\n\r\n1210\r\n01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:18,760\r\ncategory so just bear with me for a\r\n\r\n1211\r\n01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,880\r\nmoment it will make sense in a bit so\r\n\r\n1212\r\n01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,480\r\nlet's just open the curly\r\n\r\n1213\r\n01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,318\r\nbrackets and here as I was saying we\r\n\r\n1214\r\n01:01:27,318 --> 01:01:30,318\r\nwill create two properties I'll name the\r\n\r\n1215\r\n01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:31,400\r\nfirst one\r\n\r\n1216\r\n01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,880\r\ncategory that will take the key which we\r\n\r\n1217\r\n01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,960\r\nare using to group our items so\r\n\r\n1218\r\n01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,199\r\nbasically this property will take each\r\n\r\n1219\r\n01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:42,199\r\ncategory and the second property I'll\r\n\r\n1220\r\n01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,599\r\nname it\r\n\r\n1221\r\n01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:49,159\r\ntotal and here we will use the sum\r\n\r\n1222\r\n01:01:49,159 --> 01:01:53,278\r\nmethod to sum all of the amounts of the\r\n\r\n1223\r\n01:01:53,278 --> 01:01:56,519\r\nexpenses that belong to this category so\r\n\r\n1224\r\n01:01:56,519 --> 01:01:58,719\r\nthis is what we are\r\n\r\n1225\r\n01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:02,159\r\ndoing and at the end we just need to\r\n\r\n1226\r\n01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:05,119\r\nreturn this data variable it may seem a\r\n\r\n1227\r\n01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:07,599\r\nbit a lot but all we're doing is we're\r\n\r\n1228\r\n01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:10,880\r\nfiltering our expenses grouping them by\r\n\r\n1229\r\n01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,440\r\ncategory we are creating an anonymous\r\n\r\n1230\r\n01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,838\r\nobject where we are specifying two\r\n\r\n1231\r\n01:02:15,838 --> 01:02:17,358\r\nproperties the one will take each\r\n\r\n1232\r\n01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:19,920\r\ncategory the second one will make a sum\r\n\r\n1233\r\n01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,440\r\nof the amount of all of the expenses\r\n\r\n1234\r\n01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,239\r\nthat belong to the same category and\r\n\r\n1235\r\n01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:26,400\r\nthen we will actually use this category\r\n\r\n1236\r\n01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,679\r\nand total\r\n\r\n1237\r\n01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:30,599\r\nproperties if we go to this\r\n\r\n1238\r\n01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:32,719\r\ndocumentation we will use them as the\r\n\r\n1239\r\n01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:35,159\r\nlabel the category will be placed at the\r\n\r\n1240\r\n01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:37,639\r\nlabel and then at the data here we will\r\n\r\n1241\r\n01:02:37,639 --> 01:02:40,079\r\nhave the the total expenses amount

this\r\n\r\n1274\r\n01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:26,599\r\nresponse here let me open up the curly\r\n\r\n1275\r\n01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:29,358\r\nbrackets and we're going to input this\r\n\r\n1276\r\n01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:31,838\r\nchart function\r\n\r\n1277\r\n01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:36,400\r\nhere inside of this curly brackets I'm\r\n\r\n1278\r\n01:04:36,400 -->

specify this\r\n\r\n1281\r\n01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,159\r\noptions so let me just cut this\r\n\r\n1282\r\n01:04:49,159 --> 01:04:53,119\r\npart and input it right here let me just\r\n\r\n1283\r\n01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:58,440\r\ninden this a little bit\r\n\r\n1284\r\n01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,358\r\nokay now we are creating a new chart we\r\n\r\n1285\r\n01:05:01,358 --> 01:05:04,880\r\nare accessing this variable that is\r\n\r\n1286\r\n01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,079\r\nlinked to our canvas\r\n\r\n1287\r\n01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:09,719\r\nelement and the type of the

for\r\n\r\n1290\r\n01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,239\r\nthe\r\n\r\n1291\r\n01:05:17,239 --> 01:05:19,239\r\nlabels we\r\n\r\n1292\r\n01:05:19,239 --> 01:05:23,199\r\nare accessing the data that we are\r\n\r\n1293\r\n01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,760\r\ntaking as a response we'll use the map\r\n\r\n1294\r\n01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,278\r\nfunction JavaScript\r\n\r\n1295\r\n01:05:28,278 -->

and\r\n\r\n1298\r\n01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,239\r\nhere for the data sets I'm going to\r\n\r\n1299\r\n01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:43,318\r\nremove this part I remove the Border\r\n\r\n1300\r\n01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:48,318\r\nwidth as\r\n\r\n1301\r\n01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:51,679\r\nwell and for the data for the main data\r\n\r\n1302\r\n01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:55,838\r\nof our chart I'm actually going to take\r\n\r\n1303\r\n01:05:55,838 --> 01:06:00,318\r\nthe total property\r\n\r\n1304\r\n01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:05,318\r\nso d goes to D not\r\n\r\n1305\r\n01:06:05,318 --> 01:06:09,039\r\ntotal let me check if we have closed all\r\n\r\n1306\r\n01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:13,119\r\nof the brackets I think we have and let\r\n\r\n1307\r\n01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:21,880\r\nme just run the application and test it\r\n\r\n1308\r\n01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:26,079\r\nout okay this is our pie chart let me\r\n\r\n1309\r\n01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:29,559\r\njust this looks horrible let me just\r\n\r\n1310\r\n01:06:29,559 --> 01:06:34,039\r\ninput here at this canvas element some\r\n\r\n1311\r\n01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:36,318\r\nparameters for the width and for the\r\n\r\n1312\r\n01:06:36,318 --> 01:06:38,639\r\nheight let me\r\n\r\n1313\r\n01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:43,679\r\njust input the maximum\r\n\r\n1314\r\n01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:50,119\r\nwidth to be like 450 pixels and\r\n\r\n1315\r\n01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:52,400\r\nthe maximum\r\n\r\n1316\r\n01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,278\r\nheight to be again\r\n\r\n1317\r\n01:06:56,278 --> 01:07:00,960\r\n150 pixels let me run the app one more\r\n\r\n1318\r\n01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,838\r\ntime okay this looks a little bit better\r\n\r\n1319\r\n01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:05,920\r\nso as you can see in our pie chart we\r\n\r\n1320\r\n01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,159\r\nhave two of our categories here personal\r\n\r\n1321\r\n01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:12,880\r\ndevelopment and regular monthly expenses\r\n\r\n1322\r\n01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,079\r\nfor regular monthly expenses we have\r\n\r\n1323\r\n01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:18,719\r\nspent $300 which is a bit over the half\r\n\r\n1324\r\n01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:21,838\r\nof the pie chart and for personal\r\n\r\n1325\r\n01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:24,838\r\ndevelopment we have spent $200 if we\r\n\r\n1326\r\n01:07:24,838 --> 01:07:28,719\r\nwere to add like another expense of the\r\n\r\n1327\r\n01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:30,679\r\npersonal development category the pie\r\n\r\n1328\r\n01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:33,358\r\nchart then should change let me test\r\n\r\n1329\r\n01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:36,199\r\nthis out so let's go to the\r\n\r\n1330\r\n01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:39,639\r\ncreate to the create page I'm going\r\n\r\n1331\r\n01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:44,199\r\nto write here personal\r\n\r\n1332\r\n01:07:44,199 --> 01:07:47,039\r\ndevelopment let's say I don't know\r\n\r\n1333\r\n01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:49,358\r\nonline\r\n\r\n1334\r\n01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:53,159\r\ncourses the amount to be $100 if I add\r\n\r\n1335\r\n01:07:53,159 --> 01:07:56,960\r\nthe expense now 50% of our pie chart\r\n\r\n1336\r\n01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,480\r\nconsists of personal development and 50%\r\n\r\n1337\r\n01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,798\r\nconsists of the regular monthly expenses\r\n\r\n1338\r\n01:08:03,798 --> 01:08:06,400\r\nif we were to add another expense of a\r\n\r\n1339\r\n01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,039\r\ntotally different category we would see\r\n\r\n1340\r\n01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:11,798\r\nanother color in our pie chart another\r\n\r\n1341\r\n01:08:11,798 --> 01:08:15,199\r\nslice let me just go to the create to\r\n\r\n1342\r\n01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:17,880\r\nthe create page another category would\r\n\r\n1343\r\n01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:21,000\r\nbe let's just say like fun here I don't\r\n\r\n1344\r\n01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,880\r\nknow that's not even category but um\r\n\r\n1345\r\n01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,960\r\nlet's say nights out\r\n\r\n1346\r\n01:08:27,960 -->
